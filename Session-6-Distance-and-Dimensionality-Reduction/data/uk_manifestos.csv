This election is about the crisis of living standards,503,,Labour
and the climate and environmental emergency.,501,,Labour
"Whether we are ready or not, we stand on the brink of unstoppable change.",501,,Labour
We must confront this change while dealing with the growing inequality and insecurity in Britain.,503,,Labour
Labour led the UK Parliament in declaring a climate and environmental emergency.,501,,Labour
"The next Labour government will lead the world in fighting it, with a plan to drive up living standards by transforming our economy into one low in carbon,",501,,Labour
The climate crisis ties us all into a common fate.,501,,Labour
This election is our best hope to protect future generations from an uninhabitable planet.,501,,Labour
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said we need to cut global emissions in half by 2030 to have a chance of keeping global heating within safe limits – that means acting now, and acting decisively.",501,,Labour
The Tories wasted a decade serving the interests of big polluters.,501,,Labour
Labour will use the crucial next decade to act.,305.1,,Labour
The Tories slashed support for renewable energy while pushing through dangerous fracking.,416.2,,Labour
Now Britain is decades off course on vital emissions targets.,501,,Labour
That’s why Labour will kick-start a Green Industrial Revolution,416.2,,Labour
that will create one million jobs in the UK,701,,Labour
"to transform our industry, energy, transport, agriculture and our buildings",411,,Labour
"Our Green New Deal aims to achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030 in a way that is evidence-based,",416.2,,Labour
"just and that delivers an economy that serves the interests of the many, not the few.",503,,Labour
"Just as the original Industrial Revolution brought industry, jobs and pride to our towns, Labour’s world-leading Green Industrial Revolution will rebuild them,",416.2,,Labour
"with more rewarding, well-paid jobs,",701,,Labour
and whole new industries to revive parts of our country that have been neglected for too long.,410,,Labour
"For some, industrial transition has become a byword for devastation, because successive Conservative governments were content to sit back and leave the fate of whole industries and communities at the mercy of market forces.",403,,Labour
A Labour government will never let that happen.,403,,Labour
"We will work in partnership with the workforce and their trade unions in every sector of our economy, so that they lead the transition in their industries,",701,,Labour
"creating new, good-quality jobs",701,,Labour
and making sure that their extensive skills are passed on to the next generation of workers.,701,,Labour
We will show the world how prioritising sustainability will not only deliver immediate improvements to everyone’s lives but also offer humanity a pathway to a more equitable and enlightened economy:,416.2,,Labour
"one that protects our environment,",501,,Labour
builds international solidarity,107,,Labour
and promises a better quality of life for all.,503,,Labour
The scale of the challenge requires nothing less.,416.2,,Labour
Tackling the destruction of our planet is a question of justice – for the communities at home and abroad who are most affected by it and for our children who will bear the consequences if we don’t.,503,,Labour
Social justice will define Labour’s approach.,503,,Labour
We will make sure that the costs of the green transition fall fairly and are mostly borne by the wealthy and those most responsible for the problem.,503,,Labour
2019 saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up and act on the climate and environmental emergency.,501,,Labour
"Labour welcomed that movement and, as a government in waiting, we have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change.",501,,Labour
"Delivering the far-reaching change needed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency will require a full mobilisation of national resources, both public and private.",405,,Labour
"Labour will create a Sustainable Investment Board to bring together the Chancellor, Business Secretary and Bank of England Governor to oversee, co-ordinate and bring forward this investment – involving trade unions and business.",405,,Labour
We will ask the Office for Budget Responsibility to incorporate climate and environmental impacts into its forecasts so that the cost of not acting will be factored into every fiscal decision.,416.2,,Labour
The cost of not acting is far greater than the cost of acting.,416.2,,Labour
We will launch a National Transformation Fund of £400 billion,416.2,,Labour
and rewrite the Treasury’s investment rules to guarantee that every penny spent is compatible with our climate and environmental targets –,416.2,,Labour
and that the costs of not acting are fully accounted for too.,416.2,,Labour
"Of this, £250 billion will directly fund the transition through a Green Transformation Fund dedicated to renewable and low-carbon energy and transport,",416.2,,Labour
biodiversity and environmental restoration.,501,,Labour
"We will create a National Investment Bank, backed up by a network of Regional Development Banks, to provide £250 billion of lending for enterprise,",402,,Labour
infrastructure and innovation over 10 years.,411,,Labour
They will be mandated to lend in line with our mission to decarbonise our economy,416.2,,Labour
and creating good jobs across the country.,701,,Labour
"As well as large-scale national and regional projects, smaller loans will be available through our new Post Bank based in Post Office branches, enabling thousands of bottom-up transformational changes by start-ups, small businesses, local co-operatives and community projects in towns and villages up and down the country.",402,,Labour
We will make sure that the UK’s financial sector is helping to tackle the emergency rather than fuelling it.,416.2,,Labour
We will do this by improving the fitness of our financial authorities to mobilise green investment,416.2,,Labour
and by giving them powers to manage the risk to financial stability posed by short-sighted investment in polluting assets.,403,,Labour
Just 100 companies globally are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions.,403,,Labour
We won’t be afraid to tackle this wanton corporate destruction by taking on the powerful interests that are causing climate change.,403,,Labour
We will change the criteria a company must meet to be listed on the London Stock Exchange so that any company that fails to contribute to tackling the climate and environmental emergency is delisted.,403,,Labour
Many parts of Britain would need this investment even without a climate and environmental emergency.,503,,Labour
Years of under-investment and neglect by Westminster have left too many communities feeling powerless,503,,Labour
"and too many areas left behind with low- quality jobs,",701,,Labour
weak productivity and slow growth.,410,,Labour
"The climate and environmental emergency is a chance to unite the country to face this common challenge by mobilising all our national resources, both financial and human.",501,,Labour
But we will only succeed by ensuring that everyone shares in the benefits.,503,,Labour
Labour will make sure that investment is spread evenly across the whole country and will give powers and funding to every region and nation of the UK.,301,,Labour
We will bring about a radical decentralisation of power in Britain so that local people and communities are given far greater control over their own lives and prospects.,301,,Labour
"A Local Transformation Fund in each English region will be used exclusively to fund infrastructure projects decided at a local level,",411,,Labour
"as will devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",411,,Labour
"Our Regional Development Banks will be governed by boards made up of key local stakeholders such as local chambers of commerce, trade unions and councillors –",411,,Labour
"with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland empowered to make similar arrangements.",301,,Labour
"They will set priorities for lending, giving every region and nation a new and powerful lever to rebuild their economy on their own terms.",410,,Labour
"We will shift the political centre of gravity by placing the National Transformation Fund Unit, a key part of the Treasury, in the North of England",301,,Labour
"and build up the regional offices of government in each of the nine English regions to co-ordinate government policies at the regional level,",301,,Labour
as well as ensuring a regional voice in Whitehall.,301,,Labour
"Energy use in buildings accounts for 56% of the UK’s total emissions, making it the single most polluting sector.",416.2,,Labour
We will develop the recommendations of our ‘30 by 2030’ report to put the UK on track for a net-zero-carbon energy system within the 2030s –,416.2,,Labour
We will deliver nearly 90% of electricity and 50% of heat from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030.,416.2,,Labour
"We will build: 7,000 new offshore wind turbines",416.2,,Labour
"2,000 new onshore wind turbines",416.2,,Labour
"Enough solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches.",416.2,,Labour
New nuclear power needed for energy security.,416.2,,Labour
We will trial and expand tidal energy and invest to reduce the costs of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production.,416.2,,Labour
"We will upgrade almost all of the UK’s 27 million homes to the highest energy-efficiency standards, .",416.2,,Labour
reducing the average household energy bill by £417 per household per year by 2030 and eliminating fuel poverty,503,,Labour
We will introduce a zero-carbon homes standard for all new homes.,416.2,,Labour
"As part of heat decarbonisation, we will roll out technologies like heat pumps, solar hot water and hydrogen,",416.2,,Labour
and invest in district heat networks using waste heat.,416.2,,Labour
"To balance the grid, we will expand power storage and invest in grid enhancements and interconnectors.",411,,Labour
"We will expand distributed and community energy,",416.2,,Labour
and immediately and permanently ban fracking.,416.2,,Labour
We will support energy workers through transition and guarantee them retraining,411,,Labour
"and a new, unionised job on equivalent terms and conditions.",701,,Labour
"We will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies, so that the companies that knowingly damaged our climate will help cover the costs.",416.2,,Labour
"We will provide a strategy to safeguard the people, jobs and skills that depend on the offshore oil and gas industry.",701,,Labour
"We will not achieve the promise of a fair and sustainable economy if we repeat the mistakes of the carbon era, when the capture of a natural resource for private profit created a vastly unequal and polluting economy dominated by powerful vested interests.",416.2,,Labour
"From the depletion of fish stocks to the burning of the Amazon, profit has proved a poor regulator for use of our natural resources.",416.2,,Labour
"Whether it is the trillions of litres of water lost through leakages,",411,,Labour
barriers to renewable energy connecting to the grid,416.2,,Labour
"or the billions of pounds of bill- payers’ money being siphoned off in dividends to wealthy shareholders,",503,,Labour
Tory privatisation of our utilities has been a disaster for both our planet and our wallets.,413,,Labour
We will put people and planet before profit by bringing our energy and water systems into democratic public ownership.,413,,Labour
"In public hands, energy and water will be treated as rights rather than commodities,",201.2,,Labour
with any surplus reinvested or used to reduce bills.,503,,Labour
"Communities themselves will decide, because utilities won’t be run from Whitehall but by service-users and workers.",413,,Labour
Public ownership will secure democratic control over nationally strategic infrastructure,413,,Labour
and provide collective stewardship for key natural resources.,501,,Labour
"In the case of energy, it will also help deliver Labour’s ambitious emissions targets.",501,,Labour
"Whereas private network companies have failed to upgrade the grid at the speed and scale needed,",411,,Labour
publicly owned networks will accelerate and co-ordinate investment to connect renewable and low-carbon energy,416.2,,Labour
while working with energy unions to support energy workers through the transition.,701,,Labour
Under Labour’s plans: A new UK National Energy Agency will own and maintain the national grid infrastructure and oversee the delivery of our decarbonisation targets.,413,,Labour
14 new Regional Energy Agencies will replace the existing district network operators,301,,Labour
and hold statutory responsibility for decarbonising electricity and heat,416.2,,Labour
The supply arms of the Big Six energy companies will be brought into public ownership where they will continue to supply households with energy,413,,Labour
while helping them to reduce their energy demands.,416.2,,Labour
The Conservatives allowed the proceeds of North Sea oil to be squandered on tax cuts for the richest,503,,Labour
"and captured in profits for the few, instead of investing them in our future.",503,,Labour
We now stand at an even greater crossroads in the development of our national economy.,413,,Labour
"Under Labour, our green future will be owned by all of us.",413,,Labour
"Whenever public money is invested in an energy generation project, the public sector will take a stake and return profits to the public.",503,,Labour
Averting climate catastrophe offers huge economic opportunities.,416.2,,Labour
But Britain will only benefit from a Green Industrial Revolution with the right policies.,416.2,,Labour
"Over the past three decades, Britain has reduced its emissions at the expense of domestic industry by offshoring production.",416.2,,Labour
"This is an accounting trick, not a solution.",416.2,,Labour
It does not protect the climate,501,,Labour
and it damages jobs and communities at home,416.2,,Labour
Labour will take full responsibility for our carbon footprint instead of passing the buck.,501,,Labour
"We will instruct the Committee on Climate Change to assess the emissions the UK imports as well as those it produces, and recommend policies to tackle them,",501,,Labour
including making UK industry the greenest in the world.,501,,Labour
The Conservatives have presided over a lost decade of productivity and allowed Britain to fall behind in the green technologies of the future.,416.2,,Labour
Labour will make sure this never happens again.,416.2,,Labour
"Targeted science, research and innovation will be crucial to tackling the climate crisis,",411,,Labour
dealing with the plastic waste filling our oceans,501,,Labour
"and addressing other societal challenges, such as an ageing population",706,,Labour
"As part of our plan to usher in a Green Industrial Revolution, Labour will create an innovation nation, setting a target for 3% of GDP to be spent on research and development (R&D) by 2030.",411,,Labour
We will achieve this target by increasing direct support for R&D,411,,Labour
and reforming the innovation ecosystem to better ‘crowd in’ private investment.,402,,Labour
We will establish a Foundation Industries Sector Council to provide a clean and long-term future for our existing heavy industries like steel and glass,411,,Labour
and fund R&D into newer technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.,411,,Labour
A thriving steel industry will be vital to the Green Industrial Revolution.,411,,Labour
"Labour will support our steel through public procurement,",413,,Labour
"taking action on industrial energy prices, exempting new capital from business rates",402,,Labour
building three new steel recycling plants,411,,Labour
and upgrading existing production sites.,411,,Labour
"We will ensure that new technologies aren’t just invented here, but are engineered, manufactured and exported from here.",411,,Labour
"We will put British innovation at the heart of our procurement to support local sourcing and reshoring, so that every investment we make strengthens our manufacturing and engineering sectors and supply chains",411,,Labour
"and creates hundreds of thousands of good, unionised jobs here at home.",701,,Labour
We will use the power of public procurement to strengthen local jobs and supply chains,701,,Labour
"and will require all companies bidding for public contracts to recognise trade unions,",701,,Labour
and demonstrate equalities best practice.,503,,Labour
"As we transition, we will ensure the UK’s automotive sector isn’t left behind by the electric revolution by investing in three new gigafactories",411,,Labour
and four metal reprocessing plants.,411,,Labour
By supporting UK-made electrical steel we will ensure robust support for an end to end UK supply chain.,410,,Labour
We’ll also take on the global plastics crisis by investing in a new plastics remanufacturing industry,416.2,,Labour
", ending exports of plastic waste",416.2,,Labour
and reducing our contribution to ocean pollution.,416.2,,Labour
Labour’s progressive trade strategy will be aligned with our industrial strategy to help develop the industrial base needed to deliver high-quality exports,410,,Labour
and the decent jobs that go with them.,701,,Labour
"Labour will champion exports from the environmental goods and services sector,",410,,Labour
"building on the 300,000 jobs that the sector already sustains.",701,,Labour
"We will uphold the highest environmental and social regulations in all our trade relations,",416.2,,Labour
and will never downgrade standards as ‘barriers’ to trade.,416.2,,Labour
"Our Green Industrial Revolution will create at least one million well-paid,",701,,Labour
We will train people in the skills they need to access these jobs of the future.,411,,Labour
Britain’s skills crisis has grown under the Tories.,411,,Labour
"The Apprenticeship Levy has been beset by problems, leaving employers paying into a training budget they are unable to spend.",403,,Labour
And it is not delivering for small businesses.,403,,Labour
We cannot afford to carry on like this.,403,,Labour
"Labour will make it easier for employers to spend the levy by allowing it to be used for a wider range of accredited training, in line with guidelines set by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education and government’s wider priorities for the economy.",411,,Labour
We will launch a Climate Apprenticeship programme to enable employers to develop the skills needed to lead the world in clean technology.,411,,Labour
"Under this programme, employers will be expected to allocate 25% of the funds in their Apprenticeship Levy accounts to training Climate Apprentices.",411,,Labour
"These funds can be spent directly or allocated to a ring-fenced Climate Apprenticeship Fund, which will be topped up with any surplus raised through Inclusive Ownership Funds and made accessible to non- levy-paying businesses.",411,,Labour
"Targeted bursaries will be available to women,",503,,Labour
to encourage them to take up climate apprenticeships – the STEM of the future.,411,,Labour
We will further help small businesses by increasing the amount that can be transferred to non-levy-paying employers to 50%,402,,Labour
and introducing an online matching service to help levy-paying businesses find smaller businesses to transfer their funds to.,402,,Labour
"Labour will build a sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system,  founded on the principle that transport is an essential public service.",411,,Labour
Cutting emissions will drive our transport policies.,416.2,,Labour
We will review public expenditure on transport to ensure that it promotes environmental sustainability and contributes to decarbonisation.,416.2,,Labour
"Bus services have been devastated by the Conservatives, despite carrying more people than any other mode of public transport.",411,,Labour
"Women are especially dependent on buses, which also provide a lifeline for both older and younger people and for many economically disadvantaged groups.",411,,Labour
"Labour will ensure that councils can improve bus services by regulating and taking public ownership of bus networks,",413,,Labour
"and we will give them resources and full legal powers to achieve this cost-effectively,",301,,Labour
thereby ending the race to the bottom in working conditions for bus workers.,701,,Labour
"Where councils take control of their buses, Labour will introduce free bus travel for under-25s.",503,,Labour

taking full account of the environmental impacts of different route options.,416.2,,Labour
"We will deliver rail electrification and expansion across the whole country,",411,,Labour
We will ensure that these major infrastructure projects are a model of good employment practice,701,,Labour
and pay due regard to the environmental impact.,501,,Labour

"Our transport programme is focused on creating better, publicly accessible local transport systems.",411,,Labour
"By improving public transport, Labour will help people to become less reliant on their cars, for our better health",416.2,,Labour
and to improve quality of life in our towns and cities.,503,,Labour
The Conservatives have committed to ending new sales of combustion engine vehicles by 2040.,501,,Labour

"Labour will invest to make our neglected local roads, pavements and cycleways safer for the everyday journeys of both drivers and vulnerable road users.",411,,Labour
We will review all tolled crossings.,411,,Labour
Labour recognises the Davies Commission’s assessment of pressures on airport capacity in the South East.,411,,Labour

We will examine fiscal and regulatory options to ensure a response to the climate crisis in a way that is fair to consumers,403,,Labour
We will take action to end nationality- based discrimination in seafarer pay.,503,,Labour
A Labour government’s Green Industrial Revolution is complemented by our Plan for Nature.,501,,Labour
Our commitments to ecosystem repair and environmental protections,501,,Labour
work hand in hand with sustainable jobs,701,,Labour

We will maintain and continuously improve the existing EU standards of environmental regulation.,501,,Labour
"Our polluted air contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year",501,,Labour
with further impacts on children’s health.,501,,Labour
But the Conservatives’ air-quality measures are so inadequate they have been found to be illegal.,305.1,,Labour

Public services do more than make sure everyone has the basics.,606.1,,Labour
They create shared experiences and strengthen social bonds.,606.1,,Labour
They make our lives richer and more fulfilling.,606.1,,Labour
A decade of Tory cuts has pushed our public services to breaking point.,305.1,,Labour
Labour offers real change – we will make Britain’s public services the best and most extensive in the world.,606.1,,Labour
"We will pay for this by creating a fairer taxation system, asking for a little more from those with the broadest shoulders,",503,,Labour
and making sure that everyone pays what they owe.,503,,Labour
We will reverse some of the Tories’ cuts to corporation tax while keeping rates lower than in 2010.,503,,Labour
"We’ll ask those who earn more than £80,000 a year to pay a little more income tax,",503,,Labour
while freezing National Insurance and income tax rates for everyone else.,503,,Labour
We will end the unfairness that sees income from wealth taxed at lower rates than income from work.,503,,Labour
VAT is a regressive tax that hits the poorest hardest and we guarantee no increases in VAT.,503,,Labour
We will launch the biggest ever crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion,503,,Labour
and reform the inefficient system of tax reliefs,503,,Labour
Public services must also be accountable.,403,,Labour

The current care system is at risk of collapse.,504,,Labour
A Labour government will build a comprehensive National Care Service for England.,504,,Labour
"We will provide community-based, person-centred support, underpinned by the principles of ethical care and independent living.",504,,Labour

and provide additional care packages to support both older people and working-age adults living independently in their own homes.,504,,Labour
"Our investments in social care services will enable us to more than double the number of people receiving publicly funded care packages,",504,,Labour
improve the standard of care provided to them,504,,Labour
and remove the distinction between health and care needs.,504,,Labour

"Our National Care Service will work in partnership with the NHS, ensuring care is delivered for people, not for profit.",503,,Labour
Contracts for providing care will not be awarded to organisations that do not pay their fair share of taxes,503,,Labour
and do not meet our high standards of quality care.,503,,Labour
Our focus will be on the ethical delivery of care that ensures growing public sector provision,413,,Labour

"it lets people develop their talents,",503,,Labour
overcomes injustices and inequalities,503,,Labour
and helps us understand each other and form social bonds.,606.1,,Labour
"The Conservatives have starved our education system of funding, transferring costs onto students, staff and communities.",305.1,,Labour
They have lost sight of its value.,506,,Labour
"From cutting budgets of schools,",506,,Labour
"disproportionately in deprived areas,",503,,Labour
"and underfunding support for those with special educational needs and disabilities,",503,,Labour
Conservative policy has meant those in most need have lost out.,503,,Labour
That’s why our National Education Service will be at the heart of Labour’s plan for real change.,506,,Labour
It will provide free education for everyone throughout their lives,506,,Labour
"and will nurture every child and adult to find a path that’s right for them,",503,,Labour
"by promoting all types of learning, skill and knowledge – technical, vocational, academic and creative.",411,,Labour
Early years education is vital to children’s development.,504,,Labour
Children from disadvantaged backgrounds start falling behind their peers before they even start school.,503,,Labour
Early years education also helps parents – usually mothers – by providing a bridge between maternity/parental leave and school.,504,,Labour
But the current system falls far short of what is needed.,504,,Labour
"One thousand Sure Start centres have closed since 2010,",504,,Labour
while the Tories’ so-called free childcare offer is desperately underfunded,504,,Labour
and excludes many of the most disadvantaged children.,503,,Labour
"We will reverse cuts to Sure Start and create a new service, Sure Start Plus, with enough centres to provide a genuinely universal service, available in all communities, focused on the under-2s.",504,,Labour
"Labour will radically reform early years provision, with a two-term vision  to make high-quality early years education available for every child.",504,,Labour
We will also extend paid maternity leave to 12 months.,701,,Labour

"and access to additional hours at affordable, subsidised rates staggered with incomes.",503,,Labour

and to ensure that childcare provision accommodates the working patterns of all parents.,701,,Labour
"We will improve child development by transitioning to a qualified, graduate- led workforce.",504,,Labour
"We value the experience of current early years workers, and will offer free training to the workforce to attain these qualifications on the job.",411,,Labour
Achieving this vision will require significant investment.,504,,Labour
"We will increase funding and end the fragmentation of the current system by funding providers directly, making things simpler and more sustainable for both parents and providers.",504,,Labour
"We will recruit nearly 150,000 additional early years staff, including Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators,",701,,Labour
"and introduce a national pay scale,",412,,Labour
driving up pay for the overwhelmingly female workforce.,503,,Labour

"Labour’s funding settlement will ensure pupils are taught by a qualified teacher,",506,,Labour
"that every school is open for a full five days a week,",506,,Labour
and maximum class sizes of 30 for all primary school children.,506,,Labour
We will also fund more non-contact time for teachers to prepare and plan.,506,,Labour
"Schools have faced years of budget cuts, leaving headteachers forced to beg parents for money for basic equipment.",506,,Labour
"Despite promising to reverse their own cuts, the Tories latest funding announcement leaves 83% of schools still facing cuts next year.",506,,Labour
"Schools are being subjected to intensified testing, inspection, league tables and competition.",506,,Labour
"These aren’t improving pupil achievement or narrowing the attainment gap,",506,,Labour
but are contributing to a growing teacher recruitment and retention crisis.,701,,Labour
"The narrowing curriculum is denying many children access to modern languages, arts and music,",506,,Labour
or technical and engineering skills that will be essential in a world shaped by climate change.,411,,Labour
"Parents, communities and even teachers are shut out of decisions about schools",506,,Labour
and vulnerable children are being let down.,503,,Labour
And there is no evidence that academies deliver better results.,506,,Labour
"The Conservatives have failed a generation of children with special educational needs and disabilities, who have endured years of cuts and chaos.",503,,Labour
Labour will provide the necessary funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities.,503,,Labour
"Labour will end the ‘high stakes’ testing culture of schools by scrapping Key Stage 1 and 2 SATs and baseline assessments,",506,,Labour
and refocussing assessment on supporting pupil progress.,506,,Labour

A new teacher supply service will tackle the waste of funds going to private supply teacher agencies thanks to the government’s failure to recruit and retain experienced teachers.,506,,Labour
"We will take action to end ‘off-rolling’, removing the perverse incentives for schools to let pupils fall out of the system, by making schools accountable for the outcomes of pupils who leave their rolls.",506,,Labour
We will properly regulate all education providers,506,,Labour
"and reform alternative provision (AP) to ensure an excellent education is the right of every child,",201.2,,Labour
and improve the outcomes and life chances of some of the most vulnerable children in society.,503,,Labour
"We will ‘poverty-proof’ schools, introducing free school meals for all primary school children, encouraging breakfast clubs, and tackling the cost of school uniforms.",503,,Labour
We will bring back the School Support Staff Negotiating Body,701,,Labour
and national pay settlements for teachers.,701,,Labour

"Under the Tories, adult education has undergone 10 years of managed decline.",411,,Labour
"England already faces a shortage of people with higher-level technical qualifications,",411,,Labour
and demand for these skills will only grow as we create new green jobs.,701,,Labour
"Instead of investing in people to prepare them for the jobs of the future,",411,,Labour
the Conservatives have slashed funding and cut opportunities.,305.1,,Labour
"Labour will ensure fairness and sustainability in further education,",503,,Labour
"aligning the base rate of per-pupil funding in post-16 education with Key Stage 4,",506,,Labour
providing dedicated capital funding to expand provision,506,,Labour

"Labour will reform existing careers advice, working towards an integrated information, advice and guidance system that covers the entire NES.",506,,Labour
"We will reverse the fragmentation and privatisation of further and adult education, incorporating it into a single national system of regulation that functions for education as our NHS does for healthcare provision.",413,,Labour
"Under the Tories, universities are treated as private businesses, left at the mercy of market forces, while top salaries soar and students pay more for less.",403,,Labour
"Tuition fees have trebled and maintenance grants have been scrapped, leaving the poorest graduates with an average debt of £57,000.",506,,Labour
"Labour will end the failed free-market experiment in higher education,",403,,Labour
and bring back maintenance grants.,506,,Labour

We will work to eliminate institutional biases against BAME communities.,503,,Labour

The cruelty and heartlessness of the Tories has made the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) a symbol of fear.,305.1,,Labour
"When people feel the DWP is more about harassment than a helping hand, something has gone seriously wrong.",503,,Labour

caused families to lose their homes,504,,Labour
and forced parents to visit food banks in order to feed their children.,503,,Labour

Our ambition in designing this system will be to end poverty by guaranteeing a minimum standard of living.,504,,Labour
We will start developing this system immediately.,504,,Labour

"The Tories’ rhetoric of ‘scroungers’ and ‘skivers’ has whipped up hatred of disabled people, with disability hate crime skyrocketing, up 37% in the last year alone.",503,,Labour
Labour will never demonise disabled people,503,,Labour
"Labour follows the social model of disability – it is not people’s condition or impairment that disables them, but society’s failure to adapt to those conditions and impairments.",503,,Labour
We are committed to removing the barriers constructed by society and ensuring that disabled people can participate fully and equally in our society.,503,,Labour
"The Conservatives have created a hostile environment for disabled people, who have borne the brunt of Tory cuts.",503,,Labour
The United Nations has said that the Tories have systematically and gravely violated disabled people’s rights by denying them the support they are entitled to.,201.2,,Labour
Labour will end this hostile environment.,305.1,,Labour
We will give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,201.2,,Labour
and amend the Equality Act to reflect the social model of disability.,201.2,,Labour
"We will stop the dehumanising Work Capability and PIP Assessments, which repeatedly and falsely find ill or disabled people fit to work,",504,,Labour
and make sure all assessments are done in-house.,504,,Labour
Social security is meant to help disabled people cope with the additional costs and disadvantages they face.,504,,Labour
But the Tories have cut back that support to inadequate levels.,504,,Labour
Time and again disabled people have had to fight through the courts to receive the support they are entitled to.,504,,Labour

"and reviewing support for disabled people at work, including the Access to Work scheme.",503,,Labour
People work hard for most of their lives and deserve a decent retirement free of financial stress and insecurity.,504,,Labour
"Under the Tories, 400,000 pensioners have been pushed into poverty",504,,Labour
and a generation of women born in the 1950s have had their pension age changed without fair notification.,503,,Labour
This betrayal left millions of women with no time to make alternative plans – with sometimes devastating personal consequences.,503,,Labour
"Labour recognises this injustice, and will work with these women to design a system of recompense for the losses and insecurity they have suffered.",503,,Labour
We will ensure that such an injustice can never happen again by legislating to prevent accrued rights to the state pension from being changed.,504,,Labour
The Conservatives have repeatedly raised the state pension age despite overseeing a decline in life expectancy.,504,,Labour
"Labour will abandon the Tories’ plans to raise the State Pension Age, leaving it at 66.",504,,Labour
"We will review retirement ages for physically arduous and stressful occupations, including shift workers, in the public and private sectors.",504,,Labour

"Thanks to automatic enrolment, which was introduced by the last Labour government, record numbers of employees are now in workplace pension schemes.",504,,Labour
But too many people are still not saving enough for a comfortable retirement.,504,,Labour
We will stop people being auto-enrolled into rip-off schemes and seek to widen and expand access for more low-income and self-employed workers.,504,,Labour
"We will establish an independent Pensions’ Commission, modelled on the Low Pay Commission, to recommend target levels for workplace pensions.",504,,Labour

Labour has listened to the NUM and in government will end the injustice of the state taking 50% of the surplus in the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme,503,,Labour
and introduce new sharing arrangements so that 10% goes to government and 90% stays with scheme members.,503,,Labour
This new sharing arrangement will also apply to the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme.,503,,Labour
We will ensure that the pensions of UK citizens living overseas rise in line with pensions in Britain.,504,,Labour
"Everyone has the right to a decent, secure home.",504,,Labour
"In 1945, Labour promised to ‘proceed with a housing programme with the maximum practical speed until every family in this island has a good standard of accommodation’.",504,,Labour
But too many people are being denied their right to a good home by our housing system that treats homes as financial assets rather than places to live.,504,,Labour
There is no starker symbol of the failing housing system than the horror of the Grenfell Tower fire.,503,,Labour
"A Labour government will bring system-wide change, so that a tragedy like Grenfell never happens again.",504,,Labour
"We will introduce a £1 billion Fire Safety Fund to fit sprinklers and other fire safety measures in all high- rise council and housing association tower blocks,",504,,Labour
"enforce the replacement of dangerous Grenfell- style cladding on all high-rise homes and buildings,",503,,Labour
"while introducing mandatory building standards and guidance, inspected and enforced by fully trained Fire and Rescue Service fire safety officers.",403,,Labour
Grenfell Tower was the confirmation of a more far- reaching crisis.,503,,Labour
"Everyone knows of someone affected by the housing crisis: younger people unable to buy a first home,",503,,Labour
"families stuck on council waiting lists,",504,,Labour
"leasehold home-owners hit by unfair fees,",503,,Labour
people who are homeless living and dying on our streets.,503,,Labour
The gap between the housing haves and have-nots is at the heart of the injustice in our country today.,503,,Labour
"Since 2010, the Conservatives have slashed funding for new homes,",504,,Labour
refused to regulate for higher standards,403,,Labour
and given a free hand to commercial property developers.,403,,Labour
"There are fewer new homes for social rent,",504,,Labour
"a million more households stuck renting from a private landlord,",504,,Labour
"900,000 fewer young people owning a home",503,,Labour
and more than twice as many people sleeping on our streets.,503,,Labour
Only Labour has a plan to fix the housing crisis.,305.1,,Labour
"We will act on every front to bring the cost of housing down and standards up, so that everyone has a decent, affordable place to call home.",503,,Labour
"Labour will create a new Department for Housing,",504,,Labour
make Homes England a more accountable national housing agency,504,,Labour

and upgrading millions of existing homes to make them more energy efficient.,501,,Labour
We will review the planning guidance for developments in flood risk areas.,501,,Labour
The only way to deliver on everyone’s right to a good home is to build publicly funded social housing.,504,,Labour
"Labour will deliver a new social housebuilding programme of more than a million homes over a decade, with council housing at its heart.",504,,Labour
"By the end of the Parliament we will be building at an annual rate of at least 150,000 council and social homes,",504,,Labour
"with 100,000 of these built by councils for social rent in the biggest council housebuilding programme in more than a generation.",504,,Labour
"We will establish a new duty on councils to plan and build these homes in their area,",504,,Labour
"and fund them to do so, with backing from national government.",504,,Labour
"We will scrap the Conservatives’ bogus definition of ‘affordable’, set as high as 80% of market rents, and replace it with a definition linked to local incomes.",503,,Labour
These council and housing association homes will be more affordable than market housing,503,,Labour
We will end the conversion of office blocks to homes that sidestep planning permission through ‘permitted development’.,403,,Labour
"We will stop the haemorrhage of low- cost homes by ending the right to buy,",503,,Labour
along with the forced conversion of social rented homes to so-called ‘affordable rent’.,503,,Labour
We will review the case for reducing the amount of housing debt councils currently hold.,503,,Labour
And we will give councils the powers and funding to buy back homes from private landlords.,301,,Labour
We will give tenants a stronger say in the management of their homes,503,,Labour

and that all residents are offered a new property on the same site and terms.,503,,Labour
We will fund a new Decent Homes programme to bring all council and housing association homes up to a good standard.,504,,Labour
"Under the Tories, home ownership is getting further out of reach for more and more people.",503,,Labour

We will reform Help to Buy to focus it on first-time buyers on ordinary incomes.,503,,Labour

Labour will end the scandal of leasehold for the millions who have bought their home but don’t feel like they own it.,403,,Labour
"We will end the sale of new leasehold properties,",403,,Labour
"abolish unfair fees and conditions,",403,,Labour
and give leaseholders the right to buy their freehold at a price they can afford.,403,,Labour
We will introduce equivalent rights for freeholders on privately owned estates.,403,,Labour
More than 11 million people rent from a private landlord and many of them are at the sharp end of the housing crisis.,503,,Labour

"But under the Tories, the number of people sleeping rough has more than doubled.",503,,Labour
"Over 125,000 children are now living in temporary accommodation, without a home to call their own – or the space they need to thrive.",503,,Labour

The time has come for the real changes that a Labour government will bring.,202.1,,Labour
"We will act immediately to end the hereditary principle in the House of Lords,",202.1,,Labour
"and work to abolish the House of Lords in favour of Labour’s preferred option of an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions,",202.1,,Labour
but we also believe that the people must be central to historic political changes.,202.1,,Labour
"The renewal of our Parliament will be subject to recommendations made by a UK-wide Constitutional Convention, led by a citizens’ assembly.",202.1,,Labour
"This Convention will answer crucial questions on how power is distributed in the UK today,",202.1,,Labour
how nations and regions can best relate to each other,202.1,,Labour
and how a Labour government can best put power in the hands of the people.,202.1,,Labour
"Only a Labour government will safeguard the future of a devolved UK, reforming the way in which it works to make it fit for the future.",305.1,,Labour
Britain is one of the most centralised countries in Europe.,301,,Labour

"Any form of Brexit will damage our economy, put jobs at risk, hurt our NHS and put our family of nations under enormous strain.",108,,LibDems
There is no Brexit deal that will ever be as good as the deal we currently have as a member of the European Union.,108,,LibDems
Our determination to stop Brexit isn’t just about retaining membership of this or that EU institution.,108,,LibDems
It’s about who we are as a country and the values that drive our choices.,601.1,,LibDems
"It’s about choosing to work with others in taking on the big challenges that we face, whether it’s the climate crisis or cybercrime.",107,,LibDems
It’s about recognising that the zero-sum games of the past no longer apply to a world where our future prosperity is so interlinked with that of our closest allies.,107,,LibDems
"Staying in the European Union will secure a £50 billion Remain Bonus, with the economy two per cent larger by 2024-25.",108,,LibDems
"We can invest that bonus in our schools,",506,,LibDems
and on tackling in-work poverty and inequality.,503,,LibDems
A Liberal Democrat government will take urgent action to save our planet.,501,,LibDems
We are the last generation that can stop irreversible climate change.,501,,LibDems
We’ve already seen how floods and wildfires are becoming an ever more regular occurrence in our country.,501,,LibDems
"And, though we should be proud to be the first country to declare a climate emergency,",501,,LibDems
we cannot ignore the fact that the government has done little else since then.,501,,LibDems
"In the meantime, it’s been young people who have consistently put the climate crisis back on the agenda with their inspirational climate strikes.",501,,LibDems
"The Liberal Democrats are the only party with a radical, credible and detailed plan to tackle the climate emergency as soon as possible.",501,,LibDems
We will deliver a ten-year emergency programme to cut greenhouse gas emissions substantially straightaway,501,,LibDems
and phase out emissions from the remaining hard-to-treat sectors by 2045 at the latest.,501,,LibDems
By 2030 we will generate 80 per cent of our electricity from renewables,501,,LibDems
"and cut energy bills and emissions by insulating homes,",501,,LibDems
prioritising bringing 3.5 million households out of fuel poverty by 2025.,503,,LibDems
"In government, we will give every child the best start in life, no matter their ability or background, and we will empower them to make the most of the challenges ahead.",503,,LibDems
"But currently too many of our schools are falling behind, teaching assistants are being laid off",506,,LibDems
and cash-strapped councils are struggling to support children with complex needs.,506,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats will invest in schools to build a brighter future for our children.,506,,LibDems
We will reverse school cuts with an emergency cash injection so that pupils have the resources they need to learn.,506,,LibDems
"We will increase teacher numbers by 20,000 and let them get on with their jobs, instead of worrying about budgeting for the basics.",506,,LibDems
"We will create a fairer economy, where every person can live a secure, happy and fulfilling life.",503,,LibDems
"To do that, we will provide free childcare for all children with parents in work from nine months",504,,LibDems
"and for all children from two years, up to the time they start school.",504,,LibDems
"This will plug the gap in provision, ensuring that parents have an easier choice when it comes to returning to work after parental leave.",504,,LibDems
The great advancements in technology and the ever-changing nature of the world of work mean that more of us will change careers throughout our lives.,506,,LibDems
And it simply isn’t good enough to say that education stops after school or university.,506,,LibDems
"A Liberal Democrat government will set up a new Skills Wallet for every adult, giving people £10,000 to spend on approved education and training courses to gain the right skills for the jobs of the future.",506,,LibDems
"Creating a fairer economy is about reinventing the relationship between business and the communities in which they operate, so that they are part of the solution to our biggest challenges, not the problem.",503,,LibDems
"Finally, we will transform our mental health service by treating it with the same urgency as physical health.",504,,LibDems
"About one in four people in the UK experience a mental health problem each year, and while the NHS may be the envy of the world, our mental health service falls far short of what patients deserve.",504,,LibDems
"Nearly two-thirds of children and young people with diagnosable mental health conditions are not receiving treatment,",504,,LibDems
"and waiting times for psychological therapy can range from just over two weeks to six months, depending on where you are in the country.",504,,LibDems
"Over the next Parliament, a Liberal Democrat government will invest £11 billion in mental health to expand access to therapies",504,,LibDems
and increase the number of psychiatrists and specialist mental health practitioners.,504,,LibDems
"We will make mental health services 24- hour, including placing mental health liaison teams in all hospitals so that those facing a mental health crisis are not put in police cells.",504,,LibDems
This is the Liberal Democrat plan for a brighter future.,305.1,,LibDems
Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit and stay in the European Union.,108,,LibDems
For over three years Liberal Democrats have led the fight to stop Brexit.,108,,LibDems
We campaigned to stay in the EU in 2016 and we unequivocally believe that the UK is stronger as part of the EU.,108,,LibDems
"The election of a Liberal Democrat majority government on a clear stop Brexit platform will provide a democratic mandate to stop this mess, revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU.",108,,LibDems
"In other circumstances, we will continue to fight for a people’s vote with the option to stay in the EU,",108,,LibDems
and in that vote we would passionately campaign to keep the UK in the EU.,108,,LibDems
Electing a Liberal Democrat government is the only way to get the Brexit process over.,108,,LibDems
"Although the Conservatives claim that a vote for them will ‘get Brexit done’, it won’t:",305.1,,LibDems
"it will simply usher in more years of difficult negotiations over the UK’s trade deal with the EU, with a very high chance of Britain crashing out and trying to survive on so-called ‘WTO terms’ – a deal so bad that almost no other country anywhere in the world trades on that basis.",108,,LibDems
Labour want to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement all over again and negotiate a new deal – but they will not say whether they want Britain to remain in the EU or leave.,305.1,,LibDems
"The fact is that whether Labour Red or Tory Blue, Brexit is bad for the UK.",108,,LibDems
The importance of the UK’s membership of the EU has never been clearer.,108,,LibDems
"Working together through the EU, the countries of Europe have achieved peace and prosperity on a continent historically wracked by war and division.",108,,LibDems
"That is a tremendous achievement; it should not be taken for granted, particularly as Europe faces new dangers from an increasingly aggressive Russia and as the US turns away from its old alliances.",108,,LibDems
"Many of the great challenges of the 21st century are global: climate change, human trafficking, the arms trade, the power of multinationals, global poverty and inequality.",108,,LibDems
"By separating itself from the EU, Britain diminishes its capacity to respond to these threats.",108,,LibDems
"By working together with our European neighbours, we increase the UK’s ability to meet those challenges: for example, in international negotiations, in regulating the tech giants or in creating markets for climate-friendly products.",108,,LibDems
There is no doubt that full membership of the EU is good for the British economy.,108,,LibDems
Brexit would bring to an end businesses’ unfettered access to the European single market – the destination of almost half of Britain’s exports – and to the smooth flow of goods that complex industrial supply chains require.,108,,LibDems
The prospect of tariffs and border checks is already causing manufacturers to shift their operations to other EU states and UK manufacturers are already reporting that export orders have dried up.,108,,LibDems
There is no prospect of replacing lost EU markets with free trade agreements with other countries thousands of miles away.,108,,LibDems
"If the UK gives in to President Trump’s demands to lower environmental and health standards for a trade deal with the US, we would lose the ability to export to the EU,",108,,LibDems
"which would drive many British businesses, including most farmers, out of business.",108,,LibDems
"Brexit will also mean an end to freedom of movement, which has brought the UK tremendous social, economic and cultural benefits.",108,,LibDems
"It gives British people the opportunity to work, be together with their loved ones, study and retire anywhere in the EU.",108,,LibDems
"There is no contradiction between our European and our British, national and regional identities: they enrich one another.",108,,LibDems
"By stopping Brexit, Liberal Democrats will protect and maintain freedom of movement, safeguarding the rights of UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.",108,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats will also support the right of the people of Gibraltar to remain in the European Union.,108,,LibDems
"EU citizens are valued members of our communities and we believe that they should be afforded the right to full participation in civic life, including the ability to stand for office and vote in UK referendums, European elections and general elections as well as local elections.",108,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats will extend these rights to all EU citizens who have lived in the UK for five years or longer.,108,,LibDems
"To ensure that EU citizens are not denied their vote in any election or referendum, we will also implement urgent electoral law reform, in line with the Electoral Commission’s 2014 recommendations,",108,,LibDems
including introducing a legal requirement for councils to inform citizens of the steps they must take to be successfully registered,202.1,,LibDems
and making the necessary changes to ensure that the UK has an automatic system of inclusion in elections.,202.1,,LibDems
"The national humiliation of Brexit puts so much at risk – the NHS, public services, jobs across the country, scientific collaboration, peace in Northern Ireland, the unity of the UK, our ability to tackle global crises such as climate change and our global reputation as a country that is confident and outward-facing.",108,,LibDems
"By keeping the UK in the EU, we can get on with tackling the real issues facing our country,",108,,LibDems
using the Remain Bonus of £50 billion to invest in public services,504,,LibDems
A Liberal Democrat government will stop Brexit – and build a brighter future for the UK by keeping us at the heart of the European Union.,108,,LibDems
"People who work hard and contribute to society should have good, fulfilling and well- paid jobs.",701,,LibDems
Businesses and entrepreneurs who innovate and invest and behave responsibly to their employees and to the environment should be supported.,416.2,,LibDems
"But this is not how the UK is today: too many people can’t get on, and live secure, happy and fulfilling lives.",503,,LibDems
"The failure of governments to invest in infrastructure and skills has undermined productivity,",411,,LibDems
and now the Conservatives threaten to make the vast majority of people poorer,503,,LibDems
and punish business and enterprise through a hard Brexit.,108,,LibDems
"Meanwhile, we are facing profound economic changes that demand new partnerships between government and business:,",402,,LibDems
the emergence of artificial intelligence requires new approaches to work,411,,LibDems
and the challenge of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy must be managed in a way that does not hurt the least well-off,503,,LibDems
and makes the UK more competitive.,402,,LibDems
"The UK’s strengths in science, financial services, the creative industries and high-tech manufacturing mean that we should be well placed to build an economy that treats business as part of the solution",402,,LibDems
and spreads opportunity to everyone.,503,,LibDems
"However, neither Labour nor the Conservatives are capable of guiding the economy through these challenges.",305.1,,LibDems
Both parties are reaching to the past for answers that are no longer relevant.,305.1,,LibDems
"The Conservatives are pursuing a deregulated, low-tax Brexit that will set our economy back for generations;",410,,LibDems
Labour are facilitating Brexit while seeking to renationalise their way back to a form of 1970s socialism.,401,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are now the natural home of business: we are the only party with a new plan for a brighter economic future.,402,,LibDems
A plan to invest in climate-friendly infrastructure and technology,411,,LibDems
and create new green businesses,416.2,,LibDems
"a plan to build on our scientific, technological and creative strengths;",411,,LibDems
"and build a more prosperous, equal and inclusive economy.",503,,LibDems
"Whichever part of the country people are from and whatever stage of their career they are at, our plan will mean greater opportunities",503,,LibDems
"Our priorities in the next parliament will be: Investing £130 billion in infrastructure – upgrading our transport and energy systems,",411,,LibDems
empowering all regions and nations of the UK,503,,LibDems
and developing the climate-friendly infrastructure of the future.,416.2,,LibDems
"Enabling an adaptable, future-focused workforce// –",701,,LibDems
"empowering individuals through new Skills Wallets worth £10,000 for every individual.",411,,LibDems
Introducing a wellbeing budget and basing decisions for government spending on what will improve wellbeing as well as on economic and fiscal indicators.,504,,LibDems
"Opportunity and access to education, employment and services are not fairly spread around the country.",503,,LibDems
This means that many people become stuck in insecure work in which they have no prospect of promotion.,701,,LibDems
The Conservatives pay lip service to the idea of regional growth,305.1,,LibDems
while pursuing a reckless Brexit that will deepen inequality,503,,LibDems
and place trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK;,406,,LibDems
Labour’s backwards-looking approach of Whitehall running renationalised industries denies people and communities autonomy and will hit investment and stifle innovation.,401,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are the only party looking to the future with a plan to kickstart adevolution revolution that will give all parts of the UK a real say backed by meaningful financial muscle.,301,,LibDems
This is the only sustainable answer to the regional divide. We will:Give local authorities and regions the power to make decisions about their areas.,301,,LibDems
"Introduce a capital £50 billion Regional Rebalancing Programme for infrastructure spend across the nations and regions of the UK,",301,,LibDems
"with local and devolved authorities given a say in how it is used,",301,,LibDems
reinforced by a Just Transition Fund to support communities negatively affected by policies to tackle the climate emergency.,301,,LibDems
"Continue to champion investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the Midlands Engine,",301,,LibDems
putting significant capital resources into infrastructure projects across these regions.,411,,LibDems
Set an ambitious National Industrial Strategy to transform the economy,410,,LibDems
and develop Local Industrial Strategies within it that incentivise clustering by businesses and universities with particular specialisations.,402,,LibDems
Work with the major banks to fund the creation of a local banking sector dedicated to meeting the needs of local small and medium-sized businesses.,402,,LibDems
"Expand the British Business Bank to perform a more central role in the economy, to ensure that viable small and medium-sized businesses have access to capital, even when the rest of the commercial banking system can’t provide it.",402,,LibDems
Support the tourist industry which is vital for many local economies by:,410,,LibDems
"Upgrading the status of tourism within government, by creating a Department of Digital, Culture, Media, Sport and Tourism, with a designated Minister of State for Tourism.",410,,LibDems
Enabling local authorities to bring in tourist levies to fund local tourism infrastructure.,402,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats want to take advantage of historically low interest rates to increase borrowing for investment to build the economy of the future.,410,,LibDems
"We are committed to a responsible and realistic £130 billion package of additional infrastructure investment, which will prioritise:",411,,LibDems
"Significant investment in public transport, including converting the rail network to ultra-low-emission technology (electric or hydrogen) by 2035,",411,,LibDems
"and a continued commitment to HS2, Crossrail 2 and other major new strategic rail routes.",411,,LibDems

– with a particular focus on connecting rural areas.,411,,LibDems

"including 100,000 social homes.",504,,LibDems
"An emergency ten-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all the UK’s buildings, cutting emissions and fuel bills",416.2,,LibDems
and hospitals to support capacity increases and modernisation.,504,,LibDems
"£5 billion of initial capital for a new Green Investment Bank,",416.2,,LibDems
using public money to attract private investment for zero-carbon priorities.,416.2,,LibDems
We will ensure that the National Infrastructure Commission takes fully into account the climate and environmental implications of all national infrastructure decisions.,416.2,,LibDems
We want to lay the foundations for the UK to be the best place in the world for innovation-led businesses in the long-term – to be a place where people come from across the EU and the world to turn their ideas into reality.,402,,LibDems
"But with R&D and innovation investment lagging behind other countries and being overly concentrated in South East England, it needs major change to make this vision a reality.",402,,LibDems
"Only the Liberal Democrats can deliver this; the Conservatives are harking back to a romanticised imperial past,",305.1,,LibDems
"while pursuing a Brexit that will hit research and innovation, which is so dependent on European and other international collaboration,",108,,LibDems
while Labour has no plan for the economy of the future.,305.1,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats have a transformative plan to make the UK a world leader in responsible innovation by taking advantage of the UK’s strengths and what we are good at as a nation:,601.1,,LibDems
"our natural advantages in renewable energy;  our strong university sector  and our regional strengths such as bioscience in the Midlands, advanced materials in Yorkshire, zero-carbon technology in the North West and photonics in Scotland.",416.2,,LibDems
We will build a growing economy in which people will have well-paid and fulfilling jobs.,701,,LibDems
We will: Increase national spending on research and development to three per cent of GDP.,411,,LibDems
"We will publish a roadmap to achieve this ambition by the earliest date possible, via an interim target of 2.4 per cent of GDP by no later than 2027.",411,,LibDems

creating more ‘Catapult’ innovation and technology centres,411,,LibDems
and backing private investment in particular in zero-carbon and environmental innovation.,416.2,,LibDems
Develop the skilled workforce needed to support this growth by introducing a new two-year visa for students to work after graduation,411,,LibDems
"and a major expansion of high-quality apprenticeships including Higher Apprenticeships, backed up by new sector-led National Colleges.",411,,LibDems
"Develop a national skills strategy for key sectors, including zero-carbon technologies, to help match skills and people;",411,,LibDems

Reform building standards to ensure that all new homes built from 2022 have full connectivity to ultra-fast broadband,411,,LibDems
and are designed to enable the use of smart technologies.,411,,LibDems
Continue to support investment in new UK digital start-ups by reforming the British Business Bank’s support for venture capital funds to enable it to help funds ‘crowd in’ new backers rather than acting as a funder of last resort.,402,,LibDems
"Support growth in the creative industries, including video gaming, by continuing to support the Creative Industries Council",402,,LibDems
"and tailored industry-specific tax support, promoting creative skills,",402,,LibDems
"supporting modern and flexible patent, copyright and licensing rules,",402,,LibDems
and addressing the barriers to finance faced by small creative businesses.,402,,LibDems
Create creative enterprise zones to grow and regenerate the cultural output of areas across the UK.,402,,LibDems
"Our ambition is for the UK to lead the world in ethical, inclusive new technology, including artificial intelligence.",411,,LibDems
We will invest in education to equip people with the skills they need – whether to use new technology or to create it,411,,LibDems
– while also attracting and welcoming the best talent from around the world.,411,,LibDems
"We will enable innovators and entrepreneurs to experiment and take risks,",402,,LibDems
"while taking on concentrations of power that stifle competition, limit choice for consumers and hamper progress.",403,,LibDems
"And we will ensure that new technology is developed and deployed ethically, so that it respects people’s fundamental rights, including the rights to privacy and non-discrimination.",416.2,,LibDems
"We will: Support the UK’s diverse, inclusive tech sector by teaching core skills such as logic, verbal reasoning and creativity in schools,",411,,LibDems

"and requiring all products to provide a short, clear version of their terms and conditions, setting out the key facts as they relate to individuals’ data and privacy.",403,,LibDems
"Enable people whose jobs are affected by automation to gain new skills and retrain with our new Skills Wallets,",411,,LibDems
"so that they can work in the good, well- paying jobs of the future.",411,,LibDems
"Dynamic, entrepreneurial businesses are a force for good: entrepreneurs, the self- employed and small businesses form the backbone of local economies and government should support them.",402,,LibDems
"However, the Conservatives are pursuing policies that make it harder to start successful new businesses",402,,LibDems
and Labour do not understand or value start-ups and small businesses.,402,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are the only party who understand the importance of these businesses and who will ensure that they have the access to funding and long-term capital that they need.,402,,LibDems
We will: Create a new ‘start-up allowance’ to help those starting a new business with their living costs in the crucial first weeks of their business.,402,,LibDems

"Expand the rights and benefits available to those in insecure forms of employment, such as offering parental leave and pay to the self-employed.",403,,LibDems
Finance the transformation of town centres by expanding the Future High Streets Fund.,403,,LibDems
Help protect our high streets and town centres by scrapping the rule which allows developers to convert offices and shops into residential properties without planning permission.,403,,LibDems
"Business can be a force for good in our economy: we need thriving businesses to create wealth  and a model of responsible capitalism generates good jobs,  shares prosperity and sees businesses promote rights and protect the environment.",416.2,,LibDems
"But the system is not working as it should: unscrupulous employers are still able to exploit their workforce and even when businesses fail, those at the top often receive huge rewards while staff lose their jobs.",503,,LibDems
And we do not yet have a framework that sufficiently rewards businesses for environmentally sustainable behaviour,416.2,,LibDems
– or penalises them for environmentally damaging activities.,416.2,,LibDems
Labour do not recognise the good that business can do;,416.2,,LibDems
the Conservatives don’t care about the consequences of businesses that are run irresponsibly.,416.2,,LibDems
Only the Liberal Democrats will promote responsible capitalism that works for the future.,305.1,,LibDems
"Our plan is for an economy that works for everyone,",503,,LibDems
"fosters a diversity of types of business – mutuals, social enterprises and community interest companies–",403,,LibDems
"We will:Encourage employers to promote employee ownership by giving staff in listed companies with more than 250 employees a right to request shares, to be held in trust for the benefit of employees.",503,,LibDems
"Strengthen worker participation in decision-making, including staff representation on remuneration committees,",701,,LibDems
and require all UK-listed companies and all private companies with more than 250 employees to have at least one employee representative on their boards with the same legal duties and responsibilities as other directors.,503,,LibDems
Introduce a general duty of care for the environment,501,,LibDems
"and human rights – requiring companies, financial institutions and public sector agencies to exercise due diligence in avoiding specified activities such as child labour or modern slavery,",201.2,,LibDems
"or specified products such as commodities produced with deforestation, in their operations and supply chains, and to report on their actions.",416.2,,LibDems
"Reform fiduciary duty and company purpose rules to ensure that all large companies have a formal statement of corporate purpose, including considerations such as employee welfare,",701,,LibDems

"Encourage new forms of incorporation and a diversity of business types, such as for large firms contracting with the public sector or providing essential utilities",405,,LibDems

Require binding and public votes of shareholders on executive pay policies.,403,,LibDems
"Extend the scope of the existing ‘public interest’ test when considering approvals for takeovers of large or strategically significant companies by overseas-based owners to recognise the benefits to the UK economy, workers and consumers of protecting UK companies from speculative or short-term interests.",403,,LibDems
Government must ensure the tax system meets the needs of a modern economy and is ready for the transition to a digital and zero-carbon economy.,416.2,,LibDems
Businesses and individuals who benefit from being based in the UK should pay their fair share in tax – and responsible businesses are willing to do this.,403,,LibDems
"They benefit from public goods such as an educated workforce, a stable economy and publicly-funded infrastructure, and it is right that they should contribute towards them.",403,,LibDems
But the taxation system is unbalanced and unfair: it is too easy for tech giants and large monopolies to avoid tax,403,,LibDems
and income from employment is taxed more harshly than income generated by wealth.,403,,LibDems
Labour and the Conservatives are looking to the past for answers that will not work today: Labour want to hike up income tax in a way that will not even ensure that more tax is paid;,305.1,,LibDems
the Conservatives have no interest in making the taxation system fairer.,503,,LibDems
"Our plan for the future will see big businesses paying their fair share,",503,,LibDems
support small- and medium-sized enterprises,402,,LibDems
and ensure that income earned from wealth is not privileged when compared to income from employment – making sure the tax system is fair to all.,503,,LibDems
We will: Restore Corporation Tax to 20 per cent – reversing the Conservatives’ reduction of this tax to 17 per cent – and keep the rate stable with a predictable future path.,503,,LibDems
Taxing income from capital more fairly compared to income from work by abolishing the separate Capital Gains Tax-free allowance and instead taxing capital gains and salaries through a single allowance.,503,,LibDems
Simplify business taxation to lower administration costs  – supporting smaller companies,402,,LibDems
– and reduce opportunities for tax avoidance.,403,,LibDems
"Replace Business Rates in England with a Commercial Landowner Levy based solely on the land value of commercial sites rather than their entire capital value, thereby stimulating investment, and shifting the burden of taxation from tenants to landowners.",402,,LibDems
"Take tough action against corporate tax evasion and avoidance especially by international tech giants and large monopolies, including by: Introducing a General Anti-Avoidance Rule, setting a target for HM Revenue and Customs to reduce the tax gap and investing in more staff to enable them to meet it.",403,,LibDems
Reforming place of establishment rules to stop multinationals unfairly shifting profits out of the UK.,403,,LibDems
Improving the Digital Services Tax to ensure tech giants pay their fair share.,403,,LibDems

"End retrospective tax changes like the loan charge brought in by the Conservatives, so that individuals and firms are treated fairly,",403,,LibDems
and review recent proposals to change the IR35 rules.,403,,LibDems
Scrap the Marriage Tax Allowance.,403,,LibDems
"People should have secure jobs, with proper rights and fair pay.",701,,LibDems
"However, changes in technology and the nature of employment have outgrown the existing system of employment rights and protections.",701,,LibDems

"Labour’s dogmatic, backward-looking approach would destroy flexible jobs that people value and harm the economy.",701,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are the only ones with a plan for 21st century work: a plan that will give employees protection and a voice at work,701,,LibDems
while enabling innovative business models to flourish in the modern economy.,402,,LibDems
We will make work pay and ensure that there are good and well-paid jobs available for people to do.,701,,LibDems

"With technology advancing and the world of work always and rapidly changing, skills learned at 18 or 21 will not last a lifetime and it has never been more important for people to continually develop new skills.",411,,LibDems
The system is not set up for this though – opportunities are limited and people do not get the chance to make the most of their talents.,411,,LibDems
We need to empower people to develop new skills so that they can thrive in the technologies and industries that are key to Britain’s economic future.,411,,LibDems
Both the Conservatives and Labour are stuck pursuing 20th century solutions to this new challenge.,305.1,,LibDems
"Only the Liberal Democrats are embracing the future, championing flexible lifelong learning that gives people the power to follow the path that best suits their ability.",305.1,,LibDems
"We will:  Introduce new Skills Wallets for every adult in England, giving them £10,000 to spend on education and training throughout their lives:",411,,LibDems
"The government will put in £4,000 at age 25, £3,000 at age 40 and £3,000 at age 55.",411,,LibDems
"Individuals, their employers and local government will be able to make additional payments into the wallets.",411,,LibDems

taking advantage of opportunities to borrow to invest in key infrastructure,411,,LibDems
while making sure that day-to-day spending does not exceed the amount of money raised in taxes.,414,,LibDems
The Liberal Democrats are the only party who will manage the country’s finances properly.,305.1,,LibDems
"The Conservatives are pursuing a Brexit that will wreck the economy for a generation,",108,,LibDems
making it impossible to sustainably invest in public services.,504,,LibDems
Labour will waste billions nationalising utilities – spending money that could be used to improve them just to bring them under state control.,401,,LibDems
Our plan for the future is built on responsible management of the country’s finances:,414,,LibDems

There is no more fundamental purpose for government than supporting people to expand their quality of life.,503,,LibDems
"A successful economy is important, because it supports jobs, income and well-funded public services – all of which matter for individuals’ wellbeing.",503,,LibDems
But the conventional focus on GDP as the objective not only of government but society as a whole is clearly insufficient.,503,,LibDems
"People in the UK deserve to have their wellbeing considered and invested in, and a Liberal Democrat government will do just that.",503,,LibDems
"Liberal Democrats understand that wellbeing requires both a strong economy and a government that considers many other aspects of life, including support for people’s mental health and good working conditions.",503,,LibDems

Cash-strapped councils are struggling to support children with complex needs.,506,,LibDems
Too many schools are unable to keep their doors open for a full five-day week.,506,,LibDems
The Conservatives are failing our children.,305.1,,LibDems
They have cut school and college budgets to the bone.,506,,LibDems
They focus too heavily on test results at the expense of giving children a good all-round education.,506,,LibDems
"The closest they have to a big idea is the backward-looking and divisive plan to create more grammar schools, despite the evidence that shows that they harm social mobility.",503,,LibDems
Labour want to waste time and money on a massive top-down reorganisation which will do nothing to improve standards.,506,,LibDems
The high-stakes culture of Ofsted inspections and testing – especially in primary schools – has led to pupils and teachers being anxious and stressed about going to school.,506,,LibDems
Creative subjects are being squeezed out of the classroom.,506,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats will build a brighter future for every one of our children.,506,,LibDems
We have a plan to boost quality at every stage of education.,506,,LibDems
"We will start with a bold offer of free childcare from the of age nine months (the end of paid parental leave), transforming the opportunities for early years education",504,,LibDems
and helping parents who want to combine caring and working.,504,,LibDems
"We will reverse school cuts with an immediate emergency cash injection so that pupils have the resources they need to learn, and let teachers get on with the job of raising standards rather than having to worry about budgeting for the basics.",506,,LibDems
Parents should get the full picture of how their school is doing.,506,,LibDems
Primary schools cannot be properly measured by just one week of tests.,506,,LibDems
There must be robust inspections that measure social and emotional development alongside attainment.,506,,LibDems
"They should support schools to succeed, instead of punishing them for failure.",506,,LibDems
Parents should not have to be kept waiting for their child’s needs to be identified and supported.,506,,LibDems

and clearing the backlog of repairs to school and college buildings.,506,,LibDems
"Ending teaching to the test by scrapping mandatory SATs, //.",506,,LibDems
and replacing existing government performance tables (‘league tables’) of schools with a broader set of indicators,506,,LibDems
"With no government support for most families between the end of parental leave and age three, and the average price for 25 hours a week of nursery childcare for a child under two now at £6,600 a year, too many new parents are forced to choose between caring for their child and their careers.",504,,LibDems
"At the same time, the achievement gap between richer and poorer, which can best be tackled in the early years, is rising.",503,,LibDems
"The Conservatives have promised to help, but their childcare policy only covers three- and four-year-olds in working families, only amounts to 30 hours a week – less time than children spend in school – and doesn’t cover school holidays.",504,,LibDems
Even the hours they do offer are underfunded and this means that many providers struggle to deliver a quality Early Years education.,504,,LibDems
"Many parents who want to work, especially mothers, can spend several years out of the workplace because they can’t afford childcare.",504,,LibDems
"This affects their career trajectory, their confidence, and their long-term earning potential.",503,,LibDems
"Liberal Democrats have a plan to deliver the best start in life for children: free high- quality childcare from nine months for all working parents, properly funded.",504,,LibDems
"Parents wanting to go back to work will get the help they need, knowing that their child will be happy, healthy and ready to start school.",504,,LibDems
"And by tripling the Early Years Pupil Premium and expanding Children’s Centres, we can give further help to the most disadvantaged children, narrowing the achievement gap.",503,,LibDems
"We will: Offer free, high-quality childcare for every child aged two to four and children aged between nine and 24 months where their parents or guardians are in work: 35 hours a week, 48 weeks a year.",504,,LibDems
Increase the funding for these free hours to cover the actual cost of nursery provision.,504,,LibDems
"Invest £1 billion a year in Children’s Centres to support families and tackle inequalities in children’s health, development and life chances.",504,,LibDems
"Triple the Early Years Pupil Premium (to £1,000) to give extra help to disadvantaged children who are at risk of falling behind from the very beginning of their education.",503,,LibDems
"Require all Early Years settings to have a training programme for staff, with the majority of staff working with children to have a relevant Early Years qualification or be working towards one.",504,,LibDems
"In the long run, each Early Years setting should have at least one person qualified to graduate level.",504,,LibDems
"Introduce ‘baby boxes’ in England, as advocated by the Royal College of Midwives, to provide babies and parents with essential items to help with health and development.",504,,LibDems
"An education system which focuses only on a narrow range of academic subjects and measures pupils’ abilities in a handful of high-pressure exams, does not give young people the skills they need to get on in life.",506,,LibDems
It also lets down those children who do not work well in exam conditions.,506,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats will ensure England’s education system delivers high academic standards,506,,LibDems
"while also helping children grow into happy, healthy and confident adults;",506,,LibDems
and nurtures and values all styles of learning.,506,,LibDems
"We will: Reverse cuts to school funding, allowing schools to employ an extra 20,000 teachers",506,,LibDems
"and reduce class sizes, restoring them to 2015 levels per pupil with an emergency cash injection.",506,,LibDems
Invest to clear the backlog of repairs to school and college buildings so we have schools that are safe places to learn in.,506,,LibDems
End the crisis in Special Educational Needs and Disabilities funding by allocating additional cash to local authorities to halve the amount that schools pay towards the cost of a child’s Education Health and Care Plan.,506,,LibDems
"Introduce a ‘curriculum for life’, in all state-funded schools.",506,,LibDems
"This will include Personal, Social and Health Education, financial literacy, environmental awareness, first aid and emergency lifesaving skills, mental health education, citizenship and age-appropriate Relationships and Sex Education (RSE).",506,,LibDems
"Teaching about sexual consent, LGBT+ relationships, and issues surrounding explicit images and content will be included in RSE.",506,,LibDems
Establish an independent body of education experts who will use the most up- to-date educational evidence to oversee any future curriculum changes.,506,,LibDems
"It would take these decisions out of the hands of politicians and put an end to unnecessary and often politically motivated changes, which disrupt children’s learning and place an extra burden on teachers.",506,,LibDems
"Reduce unnecessary stress on pupils and teachers and end ‘teaching to the test’, by scrapping existing mandatory SATs and replacing them with a formal, moderated teacher assessment at the end of each phase and some lighter- touch testing.",506,,LibDems
"Give parents school performance measures they can trust, by replacing existing government performance tables (‘league tables’) with a broader set of indicators including information about pupils’ and teachers’ wellbeing, as well as academic attainment.",506,,LibDems
"Replace Ofsted with a new HM Inspector of Schools. Inspections should take place every three years and should consider a broader range of factors including the social and emotional development of children, and the wellbeing of staff and pupils.",506,,LibDems
Independent schools should be subject to the same inspection regime.,506,,LibDems
"Improve the quality of vocational education, including skills for entrepreneurship and self-employment,",506,,LibDems
and improve careers advice and links with employers in schools and colleges.,506,,LibDems
Protect the availability of arts and creative subjects in the curriculum,506,,LibDems
"and act to remove barriers to pupils studying these subjects, including by abolishing the English Baccalaureate as a performance measure.",506,,LibDems
"Teach the core skills required for children to flourish in the modern world, including critical thinking, verbal reasoning and creativity.",506,,LibDems
"The fragmentation of the education system, with more than half of secondary schools and one quarter of primary schools in Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs), had led to a lack of accountability to local communities.",506,,LibDems
"There is competition rather than cooperation between schools, with some operating unfair admissions systems and off-rolling pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disability or those unlikely to succeed in examinations.",506,,LibDems
"With academies standing outside the oversight of Local Authorities, and many MAT schools not even having a local governing body, parents are finding it increasingly difficult to raise issues with schools, and there is little evidence that the children’s voice is heard.",506,,LibDems
"There is an increasing trend to exclude children (or use internal exclusion units), which is damaging and dangerous to the young people involved.",506,,LibDems
The Conservatives’ ideological obsession with more grammar schools will only add further division to the system.,506,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats want to restore accountability and give every child the chance of attending an excellent local school.,506,,LibDems
"We will: Give local authorities with responsibility for education the powers and resources to act as Strategic Education Authorities for their area, including responsibility for places planning, exclusions, administering admissions including in-year admissions, and SEND functions.",506,,LibDems
Create a level playing field by requiring MATs to undergo external inspection and allowing local authorities to open new Community Schools where needed.,506,,LibDems
Oppose any future expansion of grammar schools,506,,LibDems
and devolve all capital funding for new school spaces to local authorities.,506,,LibDems
"There is a crisis in teacher retention and recruitment in our schools, driven by years of real-terms pay cuts, and an increasingly unmanageable workload created by unnecessary bureaucracy.",506,,LibDems
"Teachers feel demoralised and undervalued, as the funding crisis in our schools coupled with the culture of excessive high-stakes testing prevent them from giving every child the high-quality education they deserve.",506,,LibDems
"Liberal Democrats will ensure teachers are paid a fair wage for the vital work they do,",506,,LibDems
"and that they are empowered to focus on delivering a high-quality education to their pupils, rather than being put under unnecessary pressure from testing and inspections which offer little-to-no educational benefit.",506,,LibDems
Teachers are the biggest and most important asset in our education system.,506,,LibDems
They need world-class levels of training and support to help them deliver the great teaching we want in our schools.,506,,LibDems
"We will: Raise the starting salary for teachers to £30,000",506,,LibDems
and increase all teachers’ pay by at least three per cent per year throughout the parliament.,506,,LibDems
Introduce a clear and properly funded entitlement to genuinely high-quality professional development for all teachers – rising to the level of 50 hours per year by 2025.,506,,LibDems
We will also give extra training to teachers who are required to teach subjects at secondary level where they themselves do not have a post A- level qualification.,506,,LibDems
Education doesn’t begin and end at the school gates.,506,,LibDems
"A love of learning can be nurtured from early childhood, and continue throughout life.",506,,LibDems
"However, our young people are some of the most anxious and unhappy in the world.",504,,LibDems
Schools are on the front line in dealing with children and young adults with mental health issues.,504,,LibDems
We also know that children cannot learn properly if they are undernourished.,504,,LibDems
Parents are under huge pressure and receive little support even though home is the biggest influence on children’s learning.,504,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats believe that parents need to be properly empowered and supported with the tools they need to raise the next generation.,504,,LibDems
To ensure children and adults are able to make the most of the educational opportunities which are open to them the government must also do more to support health and wellbeing.,504,,LibDems
We will:Extend free school meals to all children in primary education,504,,LibDems
"and to all secondary school children whose families receive Universal Credit,",504,,LibDems
as well as promoting school breakfast clubs.,504,,LibDems
Ensure that all teaching staff have the training to identify mental health issues and that schools provide immediate access for pupil support and counselling.,506,,LibDems
"Ensure there is a specific individual responsible for mental health in schools, who would provide a link to expertise and support for children experiencing problems.",506,,LibDems
They would also take a lead on developing whole-school approaches to mental well-being.,506,,LibDems
Give schools a statutory duty to promote the wellbeing of their pupils as part of the inspection framework.,506,,LibDems
"Tackle bullying in schools, including bullying on the basis of gender, sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression, by promoting pastoral leadership in schools",503,,LibDems

Include teaching about how to use social media responsibly in our ’curriculum for life‘,506,,LibDems
and provide advice and support for parents on how to help their children protect themselves online.,506,,LibDems
British universities are examples of excellence throughout the world.,506,,LibDems
"Their ability to maintain top-quality research activity, to attract funding and to deliver the best teaching depends on being open and outward looking",506,,LibDems
– which this Government’s disastrous approach to Brexit is already damaging.,108,,LibDems
"Liberal Democrats will protect our world-leading higher education sector by stopping Brexit,",108,,LibDems
enabling it to continue to rely on international collaboration and being able to attract leading academics from around the world.,506,,LibDems
Further Education is vital route to learning and we will invest to support it.,506,,LibDems
We will: Reverse the damage to universities posed by Brexit and related uncertainty by stopping Brexit and keeping the UK at the heart of the EU.,108,,LibDems
"Invest an extra £1 billion in Further Education funding, including by refunding colleges for the VAT they pay.",506,,LibDems
Help children from poorer families to remain in education and training beyond the age of 16 by introducing a ‘Young People’s Premium’.,504,,LibDems
"This would be based on the same eligibility criteria as the Pupil Premium, but a portion of it would be paid directly to the young person aged 16-18.",504,,LibDems
"Raise standards in universities by strengthening the Office for Students, to make sure all students receive a high-quality education.",506,,LibDems

"Establish a review of higher education finance in the next parliament to consider any necessary reforms in the light of the latest evidence of the impact of the existing financing system on access, participation and quality,",506,,LibDems

"If we fail to act, millions of people – at home and abroad – will suffer the impacts of floods, storms and heatwaves, rising food prices and the spread of diseases; the global financial system will be destabilised, poor countries could collapse and the number of refugees will soar.",501,,LibDems
The Conservatives have shown themselves unfit to lead in response to this historic challenge.,305.1,,LibDems
They have repeatedly flouted EU limits on air pollution and scrapped energy efficiency schemes that would reduce energy bills and end the scourge of fuel poverty.,501,,LibDems
They have cut support for renewable energy while trying to force fracking on communities that don’t want it,501,,LibDems
They are not on track to meet the UK’s climate targets,501,,LibDems
and are dragging their feet on reducing the use of plastics.,501,,LibDems
"They promised to restore the natural environment, but have presided over declines in many species of wildlife,",501,,LibDems
and repeatedly failed to meet air and water quality goals.,501,,LibDems
"Meanwhile, Labour’s policies are a distraction from meaningful action on the environment.",305.1,,LibDems
"They want to spend billions to renationalise the companies running the electricity grid, the water industry and the railways.",401,,LibDems
"But this would not only be enormously disruptive and ruinously costly; it would be pointless, as in reality, ambitious environmental and consumer aims can be achieved through tougher regulation.",401,,LibDems
A socialist planned economy is no way to tackle the environmental crisis.,401,,LibDems
The failures of Conservatives and Labour are not only morally indefensible but economically illiterate.,305.1,,LibDems
"Climate change and the collapse of natural systems are huge crises but they also represent a massive opportunity to create a different future, where people breathe clean air, drink clean water and use clean energy, where communities and industries live in harmony with nature, not at its expense.",501,,LibDems
We need a new government with the vision and the will to seize that opportunity.,501,,LibDems

"That means properly investing in the NHS and social care,",504,,LibDems
doing more across government to promote wellbeing and to reduce inequality at every stage of life.,503,,LibDems
It means making the shift from healthcare that kicks in only when people are ill to systems of wellbeing that help them to stay healthy and minimise levels of physical and mental ill-health.,504,,LibDems
Under the Conservatives our NHS and social care services are in a state of crisis.,504,,LibDems
The average wait for patients for a routine GP appointment is now more than two weeks and waiting times are rising in A&E and for operations.,504,,LibDems
Health inequalities are widening,504,,LibDems
and we have one of the worst rates of depression in the EU.,504,,LibDems
The Conservatives have failed the people who rely on health and care services.,305.1,,LibDems
"Cuts have left hospitals and community facilities crumbling and struggling with overwhelming debts, and they have damaged the services that keep us healthy.",504,,LibDems
"Labour’s approach is no better: their plan for the NHS is a backward-looking, top- down reorganisation which would leave it in chaos.",305.1,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are the only party which is forward-thinking and committed to pursuing the preventative measures that will secure the future of the NHS and Social Care.,305.1,,LibDems
We recognise that a well-trained and well-funded workforce lies at the heart of making sure that people can receive the care they need.,504,,LibDems
"We cannot continue to leave our NHS and care staff undervalued, overstretched and demoralised.",504,,LibDems

"Reforming the Health and Social Care Act as recommended by the NHS, to make the NHS work in a more efficient and joined-up way, and to end the automatic tendering of services.",504,,LibDems
Leaving the European Union would pose serious threats to the sustainability of the NHS and Social Care systems.,108,,LibDems
It would severely threaten the scope to recruit or retain staff from elsewhere in Europe (a problem which will be made worse by the Conservatives’ proposed ‘nurse tax’).,108,,LibDems
"It risks potential delays to medicines, cancer tests, and treatments using radioisotopes.",108,,LibDems
"If Donald Trump has his way, it means increased access by US corporations to services currently provided by the NHS and the UK drugs market.",102,,LibDems

Only a Liberal Democrat government can be trusted to avoid these risks by stopping Brexit.,108,,LibDems
Health and social care services are in a state of crisis.,504,,LibDems
"After years of underinvestment our hospitals are crumbling and there is now a staggering £6.5 billion backlog of repairs, meaning that many of our hospitals are not fit for purpose and lack money even to repair leaky roofs and replace windows.",504,,LibDems
The workforce feels undervalued and services are struggling to retain staff.,504,,LibDems

More than a million people are unable to get the care they need.,504,,LibDems
"Too often, people are left stranded in hospital after they finish their treatment and no longer need to be there because the follow-up care and support they need to go home is not available in the community.",504,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are the only party with a long-term plan for health and care services: Labour and Conservatives make short-term promises but have no long-term vision for ensuring the sustainability of these services.,504,,LibDems
We know that any party seeking to lead the country at this election should be prepared to take bold action to safeguard health and social care.,504,,LibDems
"This isn’t about doing the easiest thing, it is about doing what is right and what is essential.",504,,LibDems
"To tackle the immediate problem, we will: Raise £7 billion a year additional revenue which will be ring-fenced to be spent only on NHS and social care services.",504,,LibDems
"This revenue will be generated from a 1p rise on the basic, higher and additional rates of Income Tax (this revenue will be neither levied nor spent in Scotland.)",504,,LibDems
"Use this cash to relieve the crisis in social care, tackle urgent workforce shortages,",504,,LibDems
and to invest in mental health and prevention services.,504,,LibDems
This represents the most efficient and effective way of spending these extra resources – ensuring they will have the greatest impact on the quality of care patients receive.,504,,LibDems

"Establish a cross-party health and social care convention that builds on the existing body of work from previous conventions, select committees and the 2018 citizens’ assembly to reach agreement on the long-term sustainable funding of a joined-up system of health and social care.",504,,LibDems
"We will invite patients’ groups, professionals, the public and the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be a part of this work.",504,,LibDems
Introducing a cap on the cost of care as provided for in the Care Act but not so far delivered by the Conservatives would be a key starting point for Liberal Democrat participants.,504,,LibDems
"Introduce a statutory independent budget monitoring body for health and care, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility.",504,,LibDems
"This would report every three years on how much money the system needs to deliver safe and sustainable treatment and care, and how much is needed to meet the costs of projected increases in demand and any new initiatives – to ensure any changes in services are properly costed and affordable.",504,,LibDems
"Our ultimate objective will be to bring together NHS, Social Care and public health seamlessly – pooling budgets in every area and supporting integrated care systems.",504,,LibDems
We want to see services that work in a more joined-up way for the people who depend on them,504,,LibDems
and with local democratic accountability and transparency.,504,,LibDems
Physical and mental health should be treated equally in the NHS.,504,,LibDems
"In government, we fought tirelessly to bring this about and are proud of the strides forward that we made by legislating to give mental and physical health equality under the law.",504,,LibDems
"But we know that not enough resources reach front line mental health services and that in the fight for parity of esteem, there is still a very long way to go to achieve real equality for mental health.",504,,LibDems
Our plan prioritises early intervention to prevent people from experiencing a mental health crisis,504,,LibDems
and to minimise the number and duration of in- patient stays.,504,,LibDems
This means ensuring all young people can access support quickly.,504,,LibDems

The Conservatives have designed the welfare system based on their backward-looking view of work and families and are making the matter worse.,504,,LibDems
Liberal Democrats are looking to the future and will build a system that works for the modern world to support those who need it and help people back into work.,504,,LibDems

"Everybody should have enough to live on when they retire, but low wages and underemployment mean that people are not able to save as much for their retirement as they need.",504,,LibDems

"The Conservatives, looking back to the 1980s, have tried to solve the problem of unaffordable homes by extending Right to Buy, but that has only served to deplete stock and deepen the crisis in social housing.",504,,LibDems

"Neither Labour nor Conservatives are interested in changing our broken system, because it works to keep them in power.",305.1,,LibDems
They have been driven to the extremes and their leaders seek to win power by being slightly more palatable than the alternative – but the UK deserves better than the choice of the lesser of two evils.,305.1,,LibDems

We will drive a devolution revolution to give power to people and communities and help fund the services that people need.,301,,LibDems

Yet Brexit now threatens much of this progress.,108,,LibDems
We recognise that stopping Brexit and protecting existing levels of devolution will not be enough to create the federal Britain that Wales needs to achieve its potential.,301,,LibDems

"We also want to save millions of people, and their families, from suffering the agony of a slow decline due to dementia.",504,,Conservatives
We will make finding a cure one of our Government’s biggest collective priorities – one of the ‘grand challenges’ that will define our future,411,,Conservatives
along with the impact of climate change,501,,Conservatives
This will include doubling research funding into dementia and speeding up trials for new treatments.,411,,Conservatives
We will also provide £74 million over three years for additional capacity in community care settings for those with learning disabilities and autism.,504,,Conservatives
We need a long-term solution for social care – that’s why we are committing to an ambitious three-point plan: £1 billion extra of funding every year for more social care staff,504,,Conservatives
"and better infrastructure, technology and facilities.",411,,Conservatives
We will commit to urgently seek a cross-party consensus in order to bring forward the necessary proposal and legislation for long-term reform.,404,,Conservatives
The prerequisite of any solution will be a guarantee that no one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it.,503,,Conservatives
"Talent is evenly spread in this country, but opportunity is not.",503,,Conservatives
"As Conservatives, we believe absolutely in equality of opportunity – the idea that every child, in every part of the country, should have a fair chance.",503,,Conservatives
"It is not only the most important thing we can do to unleash the UK’s potential, but is at the heart of creating a fair and just society.",503,,Conservatives
This is why we want to ensure every child has access to a great state school,506,,Conservatives
"– that every pupil gets the qualifications they need for a prosperous future,",506,,Conservatives
while learning in an environment where they will be happy and fulfilled.,506,,Conservatives
"In his first months in office, Boris Johnson announced an extra £14 billion in funding for schools.",506,,Conservatives
"That translates to £150 million a week, and will include at least £5,000 a year for each secondary school pupil",506,,Conservatives
"and at least £4,000 for each primary school pupil.",506,,Conservatives
This also includes £780 million in new funding to support children with Special Educational Needs next year alone.,506,,Conservatives
One of the Conservative Party’s proudest achievements is that we have raised standards in our schools and improved behaviour.,305.1,,Conservatives
"Students learn best when they are stretched, challenged and nurtured – in an environment where there is no disruption and no excuses for bad behaviour.",506,,Conservatives
"In the last nine years, the percentage of children passing their primary reading check has gone up from 58 per cent to 82 per cent.",506,,Conservatives
We have strengthened teachers’ powers to deal with bullying and disruption.,506,,Conservatives
We have given schools the ability to decide how money is best spent – because we trust parents and headteachers to know what is best for the children in their care.,201.1,,Conservatives
"For our children to get the training and opportunities they deserve, they need to have the best teachers.",506,,Conservatives
"We want tonattract the best talent into teaching and recognise the great work they do, so we’re raising teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000 – among the most competitive in the graduate labour market.",412,,Conservatives
"We also want to build on our record of raising standards, improving behaviour",603,,Conservatives
and promoting knowledge and creativity.,506,,Conservatives
We will back heads and teachers on discipline.,603,,Conservatives
We will expand our programme to help schools with the worst behaviour learn from the best –,506,,Conservatives

"Unlike Labour, we believe that Ofsted inspection serves a valuable purpose not just in improving standards but in improving behaviour.",603,,Conservatives
"We will continue to help teachers tackle bullying, including homophobic bullying.",503,,Conservatives
No child should be bullied on account of who their parents are or where they come from.,503,,Conservatives
We will create more great schools.,506,,Conservatives
We will continue to do everything we can to ensure every school is a great school.,506,,Conservatives
"We will continue to support innovation, like our successful maths schools, set up for the most gifted young physicists and mathematicians.",506,,Conservatives
We will expand ‘alternative provision’ schools for those who have been excluded.,503,,Conservatives
We will also deliver more school places for children with complex Special Educational Needs.,506,,Conservatives
We will intervene in schools where there is entrenched underperformance.,506,,Conservatives
We will continue to ensure that parents can choose the schools that best suit their children and best prepare them for the future.,506,,Conservatives
And we will continue to build more free schools.,201.1,,Conservatives
"We will invest in arts, music and sport.",502,,Conservatives
"Over the last nine years we have made real improvements in maths, English and science, and given more children access to a rich academic curriculum.",506,,Conservatives
"We retain our commitment to the core subjects and also want young people to learn creative skills and widen their horizons, so we will offer an ‘arts premium’ to secondary schools to fund enriching activities for all pupils.",502,,Conservatives
"And to ensure children are getting an active start to life, we will invest in primary school PE teaching and ensure that it is being properly delivered.",502,,Conservatives
We want to do more to help schools make good use of their sports facilities and to promote physical literacy and competitive sport.,502,,Conservatives
"Children who end up in care are more likely to struggle as adults, denied the love and stability most of us take for granted.",603,,Conservatives
"We will prioritise stable, loving placements for those children – adoption where possible or foster parents recruited by the local authority.",503,,Conservatives
We will review the care system to make sure that all care placements and settings are providing children and young adults with the support they need.,503,,Conservatives
A strong society needs strong families.,603,,Conservatives
"We will improve the Troubled Families programme and champion Family Hubs to serve vulnerable families with the intensive, integrated support they need to care for children – from the early years and throughout their lives.",603,,Conservatives
"Since 2010, the Conservatives have helped more than 1,000 people on average into work every day",701,,Conservatives
And it has only been possible because of the strong economy we have helped to create;,402,,Conservatives
"and our welfare reforms, which have encouraged more people into work.",505,,Conservatives
The majority of jobs created since 2010 have been high-quality: full-time,701,,Conservatives
and outside London and the South East.,503,,Conservatives
"Whoever you are, we want to make it easier for you to get a good and rewarding job",701,,Conservatives
"– and to be able to combine a rewarding career with raising a family or caring for elderly or disabled relatives, rather than being forced to prioritise between them.",701,,Conservatives
"We want to make sure that you get to keep more of the money you earn,",401,,Conservatives
and that we keep your bills low.,503,,Conservatives
"And we want to make sure that those who can’t work, or have entered retirement, get the level of support they need.",504,,Conservatives
"We have focused, over the past decade, on making sure that work always pays – particularly for those most in need of support.",505,,Conservatives
We have raised the minimum wage significantly,412,,Conservatives
and introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage.,412,,Conservatives
"We have doubled the personal allowance to £12,500, so that everyone gets to earn a decent amount before they are taxed.",503,,Conservatives
And we have made sure the state pension keeps pace with earnings.,504,,Conservatives
"In our first months, we announced an increase in the National Living Wage to two thirds of average earnings, currently forecast at £10.50 an hour,",412,,Conservatives
and widened its reach to everyone over 21.,412,,Conservatives
"That means an average pay rise of£4,000 per year for four million people by 2024.",412,,Conservatives
"To help young people get a foot on the employment ladder, we abolished employers’ National Insurance Contributions for under-21s",701,,Conservatives
Creating millions more jobs is one of the Conservatives’ proudest achievements.,701,,Conservatives
A Labour Government that makes it harder for businesses to grow and to hire –,402,,Conservatives
that allows people to sink into dependency rather than encouraging them to work and earn – could undo all of this progress.,505,,Conservatives
"A majority Conservative Government will deliver a major package of measures designed to ensure that it always pays to work,",505,,Conservatives
while doing everything we can to protect and support those who cannot,504,,Conservatives
– and to address the cost of living pressures that we all face.,503,,Conservatives
"We promise not to raise the rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.",401,,Conservatives
This is a tax guarantee that will protect the incomes of hard-working families across the next Parliament.,701,,Conservatives
"We not only want to freeze taxes, but to cut them too.",401,,Conservatives
"We will raise the National Insurance threshold to £9,500 next year – representing a tax cut for 31 million workers.",401,,Conservatives
"Our ultimate ambition is to ensure that the first £12,500 you earn is completely free of tax – which would put almost £500 per year in people’s pockets.",401,,Conservatives
Raising a family should be the most fulfilling experience of your life.,603,,Conservatives
"But for too many parents, the costs of childcare are a heavy burden.",503,,Conservatives

"We recognise that water bills can be a major source of financial pressure, so will extend the water rebate for those in the South West.",403,,Conservatives
"On entering Government in 2010, the Conservatives acted decisively to protect the UK’s pensioners.",504,,Conservatives
The ‘triple lock’ we introduced has meant that those who have worked hard and put in for decades can be confident that the state will be there to support them when they need it.,701,,Conservatives
"We will keep the triple lock, the winter fuel payment, the older person’s bus pass and other pensioner benefits, ensuring that older people have the security and dignity they deserve.",503,,Conservatives
We recognise the value of free TV licences for over-75s and believe they should be funded by the BBC.,403,,Conservatives
"A number of workers, disproportionately women, who earn between £10,000 and £12,500 have been missing out on pension benefits because of a loophole affecting people with net pay pension schemes.",701,,Conservatives
We will conduct a comprehensive review to look at how to fix this issue.,701,,Conservatives
We will use our freedom from the EU to improve the UK’s tax regime,110,,Conservatives
not least by abolishing the tampon tax.,503,,Conservatives
"We as Conservatives believe that everyone who can work, should work – and that it should always pay them to do so.",505,,Conservatives
But we also believe that those who truly can’t work must be given the help they need.,504,,Conservatives
"That is why we will continue the roll-out of Universal Credit, which combines multiple benefits into one while building a clearer pathway from welfare into work.",505,,Conservatives
"We have already acted to increase work allowances, a move worth £630 to working families with children,",504,,Conservatives
and we will do more to make sure that Universal Credit works for the most vulnerable.,503,,Conservatives
"We will also end the benefit freeze,",504,,Conservatives
while making sure it pays to work more hours.,505,,Conservatives
"At the same time, we will make sure those who cheat the system by committing benefit fraud are punished.",605.1,,Conservatives
There is no excuse for exploiting others who have worked hard and paid in.,606.1,,Conservatives
"To help those looking after family members, especially women, we will support the main carer in any household receiving the Universal Credit payment.",504,,Conservatives
"And we will continue our efforts through the tax and benefits system to reduce poverty, including child poverty.",503,,Conservatives
Children should grow up in an environment with no limits to their potential –,503,,Conservatives
which is one of the reasons we are making it a priority to put more money in the pockets of low-paid workers,701,,Conservatives
and maintaining our commitment to free school meals.,504,,Conservatives
"We will also extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers, the majority of whom are women, to one week.",505,,Conservatives
"As part of our efforts to empower and support disabled people,we will reduce the number of reassessments a disabled person must go through when a significant change in condition is unlikely – because you should not have to provide repeated proof of your disability in order to receive support.",503,,Conservatives
We will publish a National Strategy for Disabled People before the end of 2020.,503,,Conservatives
"This will look at ways to improve the benefits system, opportunities and access for disabled people in terms of housing, education, transport and jobs.",503,,Conservatives
It will include our existing commitments to increase SEND funding,506,,Conservatives
"and support pupils, students and adults to get careers advice,",506,,Conservatives
"internships, and transition into work.",411,,Conservatives
We will reduce the disability employment gap.,503,,Conservatives
Our first duty as a Government is to keep our country safe.,601.1,,Conservatives
"One of Boris Johnson’s first actions as Prime Minister was to start recruiting 20,000 new police officers.",605.1,,Conservatives
These new officers will take violent criminals off the streets and protect us and our country.,605.1,,Conservatives
"The Conservatives will always back the brave men and women of our police and security services, which is why we will empower the police, backing the increased use of stop and search as long as it is fair and proportionate.",605.1,,Conservatives
And we will provide them with the equipment they need.,605.1,,Conservatives

Of course we should help those in genuine need – especially those who have fled from persecution.,201.2,,Conservatives

"Our new immigration system will mean: People coming into the country from the EU will only be able to access unemployment, housing, and child benefit after five years, in the way non-EEA migrants currently do.",505,,Conservatives

"We stand for the people working every hour they can,",401,,Conservatives
"those taking a risk on a new idea,",401,,Conservatives
those challenging existing markets.,401,,Conservatives
"And we stand for those who give their time to help others – the charities, community groups and volunteers who already do so much to make our country a better place.",606.1,,Conservatives
"We believe, in other words, that Britain is a great country – the greatest place on earth.",601.1,,Conservatives
"Together, we can make it greater still.",601.1,,Conservatives
"People across the UK are rightly proud of where they come from, and of their local areas.",601.1,,Conservatives
But too many communities feel let down.,601.1,,Conservatives
"Violent crime and anti-social behaviour are ignored amid a backdrop of boarded-up department stores, shops and pubs.",601.1,,Conservatives
Great towns and cities are being held back.,601.1,,Conservatives
"We as Conservatives want to give you freedom – low taxes, opportunity, the chance to realise your dreams.",201.1,,Conservatives
"But we also want to give you security – safe and pleasant streets, and the ability to take pride and comfort from the community around you.",601.1,,Conservatives
"This is why, in his first months as Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has set out an agenda for levelling up every part of the UK – not just investing in our great towns and cities, as well as rural and coastal areas, but giving them far more control of how that investment is made.",301,,Conservatives
"In the 21st century, we need to get away from the idea that ‘Whitehall knows best’ and that all growth must inevitably start in London.",301,,Conservatives
Because we as Conservatives believe you can and must trust people and communities to make the decisions that are right for them.,301,,Conservatives
"To underpin this national renewal, we will invest £100 billion in additional infrastructure spending – on roads, rail",411,,Conservatives
"and other responsible, productive investment which will repair and refurbish the fabric of our country and generate greater growth in the long run.",416.2,,Conservatives
"For example, flood defences will receive £4 billion in new funding.",501,,Conservatives
We will ensure that we are always spending what we can afford – with strict limits on borrowing and repayment costs.,414,,Conservatives
"We will use this historic investment to level up and connect this country, so that everyone can get a fair share of its future prosperity.",503,,Conservatives
Our new Towns Fund will help communities make sure their towns are safe to walk in and a pleasure to be in.,606.1,,Conservatives
"We want there to be things to do, great places to shop and eat and transport to be easy.",606.1,,Conservatives
"Above all, we want the town’s future to be in the hands of the people who live there.",606.1,,Conservatives
The Towns Fund will go to an initial 100 towns to improve their local economy – and they and only they will make the choice about what improvements their local area needs.,301,,Conservatives
"We will cut taxes for small retail businesses and for local music venues, pubs and cinemas.",402,,Conservatives
"As well as our investment in schools and technical education, we will invest £500 million in new youth clubs and services.",706,,Conservatives
A new Safer Streets Fund will invest in preventative measures like new CCTV or community wardens.,605.1,,Conservatives
"We have announced the largest cultural capital programme in a century, of £250 million.",502,,Conservatives
This will support local libraries and regional museums.,502,,Conservatives
"We will work with local universities to do more for the education, health and prosperity of their local areas.",606.1,,Conservatives
"We will establish a £150 million Community Ownership Fund to encourage local takeovers of civic organisations or community assets that are under threat – local football clubs, but also pubs or post offices.",606.1,,Conservatives
"We will set up a fan-led review of football governance, which will include consideration of the Owners and Directors Test,",502,,Conservatives
and will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing.,502,,Conservatives
And we will help communities that want to create ‘pocket parks’ and regenerate derelict areas.,502,,Conservatives
"Through the Cultural Investment Fund, outlined above, we will also support activities, traditions and events that bring communities together.",606.1,,Conservatives
"We will support local and regional newspapers, as vital pillars of communities and local democracy,",202.1,,Conservatives
including by extending their business rates relief.,402,,Conservatives
A key part of our plan to level up the UK’s cities and regions is to connect them.,411,,Conservatives
Leeds is the largest city in Western Europe without a light rail or metro system.,411,,Conservatives
And European cities are often more productive than our own in large part because they have better infrastructure.,411,,Conservatives
"We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.",411,,Conservatives
"We will invest in the Midlands Rail Hub, strengthening rail links including those between Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, Coventry, Derby, Hereford and Worcester.",411,,Conservatives
We will also invest in improving train lines to the South West and East Anglia.,411,,Conservatives
"We will extend contactless pay-as-you go ticketing to almost 200 more stations in the South East, meaning that 50 per cent of all rail journeys and almost all London commuter journeys can be completed using a contactless bank card.",411,,Conservatives
"We will give city regions the funding to upgrade their bus, tram and train services to make them as good as London’s,",301,,Conservatives
"with more frequent, better-integrated services,",411,,Conservatives
and smart ticketing – such as the vision proposed by Andy Street for the West Midlands.,411,,Conservatives
"The railways need accountability, not nationalisation.",403,,Conservatives
"So we will end the complicated franchising model and create a simpler, more effective rail system,",403,,Conservatives
including giving metro mayors control over services in their areas.,301,,Conservatives
We will make a £28.8 billion investment in strategic and local roads.,411,,Conservatives
We will invest £1 billion in completing a fast-charging network to ensure that everyone is within 30 miles of a rapid electric vehicle charging station.,411,,Conservatives
"We will consult on the earliest date we can phase out the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars,",416.2,,Conservatives
while minimising the impact on drivers,403,,Conservatives
We will require that a minimum service operates during transport strikes.,403,,Conservatives
"Rail workers deserve a fair deal, but it is not fair to let the trade unions undermine the livelihoods of others.",702,,Conservatives
"HS2 is a great ambition, but will now cost at least £81 billion and will not reach Leeds or Manchester until as late as 2040.",303,,Conservatives
We will consider the findings of the Oakervee review into costs and timings and work with leaders of the Midlands and the North to decide the optimal outcome.,303,,Conservatives
"To help communities across the country, we will restore many of the Beeching lines, reconnecting smaller towns such as Fleetwood and Willenhall that have suffered permanent disadvantage since they were removed from the rail network in the 1960s.",411,,Conservatives
We will invest in superbus networks,411,,Conservatives
"bring back and protect rural routes,",411,,Conservatives
"We will invest in electric buses, developing the UK’s first all-electric-bus town.",501,,Conservatives
We will launch the biggest ever pothole-filling programme as part of our National Infrastructure Strategy,411,,Conservatives
– and our major investment in roads will ensure new potholes are much less likely to appear in the future.,411,,Conservatives
"We will support commuter cycling routes, so that more people can cycle safely to work",411,,Conservatives
and more families can go out together.,503,,Conservatives
We will create a new £350 million Cycling Infrastructure Fund with mandatory design standards for new routes.,411,,Conservatives
We will extend Bikeability – cycling proficiency training – to every child.,506,,Conservatives
And we will work with the NHS to promote cycling for healthier living.,504,,Conservatives
"Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at Heathrow, but it is a private sector project.",411,,Conservatives
"It is for Heathrow to demonstrate that it can meet its air quality and noise obligations,",416.2,,Conservatives
that the project can be financed and built and that the business case is realistic.,401,,Conservatives
The scheme will receive no new public money.,401,,Conservatives
"More broadly, we will use new air traffic control technology to cut the time aircraft spend waiting to land, reducing delays, noise nuisance and pollution.",501,,Conservatives
We will also build on Britain’s pioneering work in electric and low-carbon flight.,501,,Conservatives
"We are Europe’s technology capital, producing start-ups and success stories at a dazzling pace.",411,,Conservatives
But not everyone can share the benefits.,503,,Conservatives
We intend to bring full fibre and gigabit-capable broadband to every home and business across the UK by 2025.,411,,Conservatives
"We know how difficult it will be, so we have announced a raft of legislative changes to accelerate progress and £5 billion of new public funding to connect premises which are not commercially viable.",411,,Conservatives
Local government is the bedrock of our democracy.,301,,Conservatives
"We are proud that Conservative councils have led the way in helping keep council taxes low, providing value for money and supporting local communities.",303,,Conservatives
We will ensure that councils continue to deliver essential local services – which is why they received a substantial funding increase in the most recent Spending Round.,301,,Conservatives
"Local people will continue to have the final say on council tax, being able to veto excessive rises.",201.1,,Conservatives
This does not prevent councils raising more – but it does ensure that they will need to have solid and convincing reasons for doing so.,201.1,,Conservatives
We remain committed to devolving power to people and places across the UK.,202.1,,Conservatives
"Our ambition is for full devolution across England, building on the successful devolution of powers to city region mayors, Police and Crime Commissioners and others, so that every part of our country has the power to shape its own destiny.",301,,Conservatives
We will publish an English Devolution White Paper setting out our plans next year.,301,,Conservatives
"Through our City and Growth Deals we have already delivered more than £9 billion of funding across England,",301,,Conservatives
"and almost £3 billion to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",301,,Conservatives
"Through bodies like the Northern Powerhouse, Western Gateway and Midlands Engine we will drive greater levels of foreign investment into the UK, promoting our towns, cities and counties around the world.",301,,Conservatives
"As part of our plans for full devolution we will also invite proposals from local areas for similar growth bodies across the rest of England, such as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.",301,,Conservatives
This is an agenda which shows that the days of Whitehall knows best are over.,301,,Conservatives
"We will give towns, cities and communities of all sizes across the UK real power and real investment to drive the growth of the future and unleash their full potential.",301,,Conservatives
The biggest problem that young people face in getting on the housing ladder is the deposit.,403,,Conservatives
"There are more than three million people, many of them with good jobs and secure prospects, who would have been homeowners before the economic crisis in 2008 but have been locked out of the mortgage market.",403,,Conservatives
"We will encourage a new market in long-term fixed rate mortgages which slash the cost of deposits, opening up a secure path to home ownership for first-time buyers in all parts of the United Kingdom.",403,,Conservatives
"We will offer more homes to local families, enabling councils to use developers’ contributions via the planning process to discount homes in perpetuity by a third for local people who cannot otherwise afford to buy in their area.",403,,Conservatives
"Councils could use this to prioritise key workers in their area, like police, nurses and teachers.",403,,Conservatives
We will maintain our commitment to a Right to Buy for all council tenants.,401,,Conservatives
We will also maintain the voluntary Right to Buy scheme agreed with housing associations.,401,,Conservatives
"Following the successful voluntary pilot scheme in the Midlands, we will evaluate new pilot areas in order to spread the dream of home ownership to even more people.",401,,Conservatives
And we have extended the Help to Buy scheme from 2021 to 2023 and will review new ways to support home ownership following its completion.,401,,Conservatives
"We will reform shared ownership, making it fairer and more transparent.",403,,Conservatives
"We will simplify shared ownership products by setting a single standard for all housing associations, thereby ending the confusion and disparity between different schemes.",403,,Conservatives
"We will continue with our reforms to leasehold including implementing our ban on the sale of new leasehold homes,",403,,Conservatives
"restricting ground rents to a peppercorn,",403,,Conservatives
and providing necessary mechanisms of redress for tenants.,403,,Conservatives
"We will bring in a Better Deal for Renters, including abolishing ‘no fault’ evictions",403,,Conservatives
and only requiring one ‘lifetime’ deposit which moves with the tenant.,403,,Conservatives
This will create a fairer rental market:,403,,Conservatives
"if you’re a tenant, you will be protected from revenge evictions and rogue landlords,",403,,Conservatives
"and if you’re one of the many good landlords, we will strengthen your rights of possession.",201.1,,Conservatives
Home ownership is one of the most fundamental Conservative values.,401,,Conservatives
"People are happier, more secure and more rooted in their communities when they own their own home – and know that they can pass it on to future generations.",401,,Conservatives
"For the UK to unleash its potential, young people need the security of knowing that home ownership is within their reach – that they too can have a tangible stake in society,",403,,Conservatives
can be rooted in their communities,606.1,,Conservatives
and have a place to raise a family.,603,,Conservatives
A majority Conservative Government will continue to increase the number of homes being built.,410,,Conservatives
But we must also rebalance the housing market towards more home ownership –,401,,Conservatives
while ensuring fairness for the new generation of renters.,403,,Conservatives
"While we want to encourage as many people as possible into home ownership,",401,,Conservatives
"we recognise that not everyone can afford their own home – and that those in social housing deserve the same dignity, respect and fair treatment as private renters.",503,,Conservatives
"As Boris Johnson has promised, we will bring forward a Social Housing White Paper which will set out further measures to empower tenants and support the continued supply of social homes.",504,,Conservatives
"This will include measures to provide greater redress,",403,,Conservatives
and improve the quality of social housing.,504,,Conservatives
"We will also commit to renewing the Affordable Homes Programme, in order to support the delivery of hundreds of thousands of affordable homes.",403,,Conservatives
"This is a key part of our efforts to prevent people from falling into homelessness,",504,,Conservatives
along with fully enforcing the Homelessness Reduction Act.,504,,Conservatives
"We will also end the blight of rough sleeping by the end of the next Parliament by expanding successful pilots and programmes such as the Rough Sleeping Initiative and Housing First,",504,,Conservatives
and working to bring together local services to meet the health and housing needs of people sleeping on the streets.,504,,Conservatives
We will help pay for this by bringing in a stamp duty surcharge on non-UK resident buyers.,403,,Conservatives
Since 2010 there has been a considerable increase in homebuilding.,404,,Conservatives
We have delivered a million homes in the last five years in England:,404,,Conservatives
"last year, we delivered the highest number of homes for almost 30 years.",404,,Conservatives
"That is why we will continue our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.",404,,Conservatives
"This will see us build at least a million more homes, of all tenures, over the next Parliament – in the areas that really need them.",403,,Conservatives
"And we will make the planning system simpler for the public and small builders,",303,,Conservatives
and support modern methods of construction.,411,,Conservatives
"Crucially, however, we need to make sure homes are built in a way that makes sense for the people already living in the area and for the families moving in:",416.2,,Conservatives
"We will amend planning rules so that the infrastructure – roads, schools, GP surgeries – comes before people move into new homes.",411,,Conservatives
And our new £10 billion Single Housing Infrastructure Fund will help deliver it faster.,411,,Conservatives
"We will ask every community to decide on its own design standards for new development, allowing residents a greater say on the style and design of development in their area,",416.2,,Conservatives
with local councils encouraged to build more beautiful architecture.,416.2,,Conservatives
Following the Grenfell tragedy there has rightly been a focus on building safety.,403,,Conservatives
"No report or review can truly capture the heartache, sorrow, anger and grief that many people feel.",503,,Conservatives
We have already committed to implementing and legislating for all the recommendations of the Hackitt Review and the first phase of the independent inquiry.,403,,Conservatives
"We will continue to work with industry, housing associations and individuals to ensure every home is safe and secure.",403,,Conservatives
"And we will support high rise residential residents with the removal of unsafe cladding,",403,,Conservatives
and continue with our rigorous process of materials testing.,403,,Conservatives
We will support community housing by helping people who want to build their own homes find plots of land and access the Help to Buy scheme.,401,,Conservatives
We will also support communities living on council estates who want to take ownership of the land and buildings they live in.,505,,Conservatives
We will support the creation of new kinds of homes that have low energy bills,416.2,,Conservatives
and which support our environmental targets,501,,Conservatives
and will expect all new streets to be lined with trees.,501,,Conservatives
"We will encourage innovative design and technology to make housing more affordable, accessible, and suitable for disabled people",503,,Conservatives
We will protect and enhance the Green Belt.,501,,Conservatives
"We will improve poor quality land,",501,,Conservatives
and make our beautiful countryside more accessible for local community use.,501,,Conservatives
"In order to safeguard our green spaces, we will continue to prioritise brownfield development, particularly for the regeneration of our cities and towns.",416.2,,Conservatives
We want Britain to be the best country in the world to start and grow a business,601.1,,Conservatives
– a place where entrepreneurs know they can build on their ideas and find success.,401,,Conservatives
Not only because businesses are good for society – creating the jobs that put bread on the table,401,,Conservatives
", and generating the tax revenue that funds our vital public services.",401,,Conservatives
"But because we believe that we should do everything we can to support those who want to start their own company, strike out on their own, and have an idea that grows into a world-leading business.",401,,Conservatives
Our mission as Conservatives is to give everyone across the country the opportunity to fulfil their potential.,401,,Conservatives
We are a highly competitive economy,401,,Conservatives
and well-respected regulatory framework.,403,,Conservatives
We have more world-class universities than anywhere in Europe.,601.1,,Conservatives
"We are a magnet for talent, and home to more innovative and successful new companies than anywhere on the continent",401,,Conservatives
– especially in the technology sector.,411,,Conservatives
"In areas such as tech, financial services, law and the creative industries we lead the world –",411,,Conservatives
and will continue to do so after Brexit.,110,,Conservatives
"Of the nearly six million businesses in this country, the vast majority are small and medium sized.",401,,Conservatives
Small and family businesses are the backbone of the economy and Britain is immeasurably stronger for their contribution.,401,,Conservatives
"Once we get Brexit done, we can use our new freedoms to ensure that Britain’s businesses can unleash their enormous potential – that they can invest, hire, export and grow,",401,,Conservatives
rather than being crushed by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell’s inexorable hostility towards aspiration and entrepreneurship.,305.2,,Conservatives
"We understand the challenge of increasing running costs, especially for smaller firms, and are committed to reducing them.",402,,Conservatives
Our plan to upgrade infrastructure will make it easier for businesses to operate – to move goods about the country,411,,Conservatives
and to connect to customers around the world via gigabit broadband.,411,,Conservatives
"And our new £3 billion National Skills Fund, alongside other major investment in skills and training",411,,Conservatives
"and our reforms to high-skilled immigration,",602.2,,Conservatives
will ensure that businesses can find and hire the workers they need.,402,,Conservatives
But we also want to tackle the other everyday obstacles that they face.,402,,Conservatives
We will cut the burden of tax on business by reducing business rates.,402,,Conservatives
This will be done via a fundamental review of the system.,402,,Conservatives
"As a first step, we will further reduce business rates for retail businesses,",402,,Conservatives
"as well as extending the discount to grassroots music venues,",402,,Conservatives
That means protecting your high street and community from excessive tax hikes,402,,Conservatives
and keeping town centres vibrant.,402,,Conservatives
We will increase the Employment Allowance for small businesses – a tax cut for half a million small firms.,402,,Conservatives
"We will support start-ups and small businesses via government procurement, and commit to paying them on time.",402,,Conservatives
We will also clamp down on late payment more broadly,403,,Conservatives
and strengthen the powers of the Small Business Commissioner to support small businesses that are exploited by their larger partners.,403,,Conservatives
"We will expand start-up loans, which have particularly high take-up from women and BAME entrepreneurs.",503,,Conservatives
"The British Business Bank has supported 90,000 smaller businesses with over £7 billion in investment or loans, and will continue to grow.",402,,Conservatives
"We will help SMEs to become exporters, so that they can seize the opportunities that will become available once we get Brexit done.",402,,Conservatives
Good regulation is essential to successful businesses:,403,,Conservatives
we will strive to achieve the right regulatory balance between supporting excellent business practice,403,,Conservatives
"Through our Red Tape Challenge, we will ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate,",403,,Conservatives
"and that we always consider the needs of small businesses when devising new rules,",403,,Conservatives
using our new freedom after Brexit to ensure that British rules work for British companies.,402,,Conservatives
"As well as encouraging investment in physical building and equipment,",411,,Conservatives
we will help employers invest in skills,411,,Conservatives
and look at how we can improve the working of the Apprenticeship Levy.,411,,Conservatives
"Every day, people risk their savings and their future by becoming entrepreneurs.",401,,Conservatives
They invent the new goods and services that improve our lives.,401,,Conservatives
"From decarbonisation to expanding the frontiers of artificial intelligence, they are tackling some of the great challenges of our time.",401,,Conservatives
"We want to be a nation of start-ups, and of successful scale-ups.",401,,Conservatives
We have more ‘unicorns’ – new billion-dollar tech companies – than any other nation in Europe.,401,,Conservatives
"We are proud of the work we have done to support entrepreneurship and want to see more entrepreneurs,",402,,Conservatives
including women and those from BAME backgrounds.,503,,Conservatives
"Some of our work has been spectacularly successful – such as the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Enterprise Investment Scheme, which we will continue in the next Parliament.",402,,Conservatives
"And by cutting corporation tax from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, we have encouraged more businesses to invest and grow in the UK.",402,,Conservatives
"Some measures have worked, but need to go further – as with R&D tax credits.",402,,Conservatives
We will increase the tax credit rate to 13 per cent,402,,Conservatives
"and review the definition of R&D so that important investments in cloud computing and data, which boost productivity and innovation, are also incentivised.",411,,Conservatives
We also have to recognise that some measures haven’t fully delivered on their objectives.,402,,Conservatives
So we will review and reform Entrepreneur’s Relief.,402,,Conservatives
"Of course, supporting enterprise is not just about championing businesses – more people than ever are moving into self-employment, especially women.",402,,Conservatives
We will therefore launch a review to explore how we can better support the self-employed.,402,,Conservatives
"That includes improving their access to finance and credit (not least mortgages),",402,,Conservatives
"making the tax system easier to navigate,",402,,Conservatives
and examining how better broadband can boost home-working.,411,,Conservatives
Conservatives believe in a corporate tax system which rewards entrepreneurship,402,,Conservatives
"We will always be whole-heartedly on the side of business,",402,,Conservatives
while making sure everyone pays their fair share of tax.,403,,Conservatives
"Already, the top 1 per cent of income taxpayers pay over 29 per cent of income tax– higher than at any time under the last Labour Government.",403,,Conservatives
We will continue to build on this to tackle tax evasion,403,,Conservatives
and reduce opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance.,403,,Conservatives
"Since 2010, we have introduced more than 100 anti-avoidance measures",403,,Conservatives
and secured more than £200 billion which would otherwise have gone unpaid – £24 billion in the last year alone.,403,,Conservatives
"We have led the international fight against aggressive tax avoidance and offshore tax havens, rewriting global rules to ensure tax is paid where profit is made.",403,,Conservatives
This has included committing 100 jurisdictions to ending bank secrecy.,403,,Conservatives
The gap between the amount of tax that should be paid and is actually collected stands at £35 billion – still too high.,403,,Conservatives
Hard-working families and businesses who do pay their fair share should know that we will not permit evasion to go unchecked.,403,,Conservatives
So we will set out a new anti-tax avoidance and evasion law.,403,,Conservatives
This will: Double the maximum prison term to 14 years for individuals convicted of the most egregious examples of tax fraud.,605.1,,Conservatives
"Create a single, beefed-up Anti-Tax Evasion unit in HMRC that covers all duties and taxes, from individual errors to deliberate non-compliance – which is put on a legislative footing.",403,,Conservatives
Consolidate existing anti-evasion and avoidance measures and powers.,403,,Conservatives
"Introduce a new package of anti-evasion measures, including measures to end tax abuse in the construction sector,",403,,Conservatives
crack down on illicit tobacco packaging,403,,Conservatives
and further measures to avoid profit-shifting by multinational companies to avoid paying taxes.,403,,Conservatives
Major multinational companies should pay their fair share of tax.,403,,Conservatives
"As part of our approach, we will implement the Digital Services Tax.",403,,Conservatives
"While always backing entrepreneurs that choose to make the UK the place to invest and set up a business,",401,,Conservatives
"we will take further action to redesign the tax system so that it boosts growth,",403,,Conservatives
and limits arbitrary tax advantages for the wealthiest in society.,503,,Conservatives
"We are also strengthening the UK’s corporate governance regime, and will reform insolvency rules and the audit regime so that customers and suppliers – and UK taxpayers – are better protected when firms like Thomas Cook go into administration.",403,,Conservatives
We will also carefully study the results of the ongoing investigation into its collapse.,403,,Conservatives
We will improve incentives to attack the problem of excessive executive pay and rewards for failure.,403,,Conservatives
"We will reintroduce legislation that protects pension pots from being plundered by reckless bosses,",403,,Conservatives
"helps savers be better informed with pension dashboards,",403,,Conservatives
and creates a new style of pension scheme which is more sustainable for workers and employers.,701,,Conservatives
The 2020s will see a transformation in jobs.,701,,Conservatives
Automation and computing will change how businesses function.,411,,Conservatives
Our plan to deliver clean energy and a carbon-neutral future means new kinds of jobs in new industries.,416.2,,Conservatives
And our departure from the European Union means we can develop forward-looking regulations to ensure we are first in line to develop and benefit from the technologies of the future.,110,,Conservatives
This requires a dramatic rebooting of our training system,411,,Conservatives
existing businesses and the businesses of the future.,402,,Conservatives
"But above all, we want to ensure that Britain’s workers have the skills they need to flourish",701,,Conservatives
– and that every citizen of this country has the opportunity to express their talents to the fullest.,606.1,,Conservatives
"Since 2010, the Government has invested significantly in technical qualifications and apprenticeships, with 3.8 million more apprenticeships.",411,,Conservatives
"In the next Parliament, we expect to train up hundreds of thousands more highly skilled apprentices.",411,,Conservatives
"But we will go further and require significant numbers of new UK apprentices for all big new infrastructure projects – new hospitals, new schools, major transport projects and so on,",411,,Conservatives
being built with pride by a new generation of British workers.,601.1,,Conservatives
"Whatever age you are, nothing is more Conservative than working hard to improve your lot",505,,Conservatives
and nothing is more important for the Conservative Party than supporting people in those efforts.,701,,Conservatives
Our reforms and investment in education and skills mean more children are leaving school better equipped for working life,411,,Conservatives
and there are more high quality apprenticeships.,411,,Conservatives
But there is much more to do to level up the skills of the entire nation.,411,,Conservatives
"Not just to improve Britain’s productivity,",410,,Conservatives
but to enable people to fulfil their potential.,701,,Conservatives
"As the centrepiece of our plan, we will create a new National Skills Fund worth £3 billion over the next Parliament.",411,,Conservatives
This fund will provide matching funding for individuals and SMEs for high-quality education and training.,411,,Conservatives
"A proportion will be reserved for further strategic investment in skills, and we will consult widely on the overall design.",411,,Conservatives
"The National Skills Fund will help to transform the lives of people who have not got onto the work ladder and lack qualifications,",411,,Conservatives
"as well as people who are keen to return to work from, say, raising a family, or switch from one career to another.",701,,Conservatives
"It will not only make this country more prosperous, but fairer.",601.1,,Conservatives
"Just as universities have been transformed by significant long-term investment over the last few decades, we need to make sure local colleges are equally excellent places for people to learn.",506,,Conservatives
We are therefore investing almost £2 billion to upgrade the entire further education college estate.,506,,Conservatives
"And we’ll also have 20 Institutes of Technology, which connect high-quality teaching in science, technology, engineering and maths to business and industry.",411,,Conservatives
"Vitally, leaving the EU also means that we can take back control of the money that was being channelled via its Structural Funds.",110,,Conservatives
"We have already announced a UK Shared Prosperity Fund, to ensure that the people of the UK do not lose out from the withdrawal of EU funding",503,,Conservatives
"(which was, of course, only a small part of the billions of pounds we were contributing),",110,,Conservatives
and to replace the EU programme with one that is fairer and better tailored to our economy.,110,,Conservatives
And we will ensure that £500 million of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund is used to give disadvantaged people the skills they need to make a success of life.,503,,Conservatives
"Taken together, this package of measures represents a profound commitment to Britain’s future –",601.1,,Conservatives
"to helping people of whatever age and background navigate the new world of work,",701,,Conservatives
"equip themselves with the skills they need,",411,,Conservatives
"The UK is home to leading universities, which attract students from all over the world, conduct vital research, and generate enormous benefits for our economy and our society.",601.1,,Conservatives
"They also do an excellent job of generating many of the skills that our economy needs, producing globally renowned scientists, entrepreneurs and creators, and enabling millions of people to fulfil their potential.",401,,Conservatives
In the next Parliament we will work to maintain and strengthen our global position in higher education.,401,,Conservatives
"The Augar Review made thoughtful recommendations on tuition fee levels, the balance of funding between universities, further education and apprenticeships and adult learning, and we will consider them carefully.",403,,Conservatives
We will look at the interest rates on loan repayments with a view to reducing the burden of debt on students.,403,,Conservatives
"We also will continue to explore ways to tackle the problem of grade inflation and low quality courses,",403,,Conservatives
and improve the application and offer system for undergraduate students.,503,,Conservatives
"Our approach will be underpinned by a commitment to fairness, quality of learning and teaching, and access.",403,,Conservatives
We will also strengthen academic freedom and free speech in universities,201.2,,Conservatives
and continue to focus on raising standards.,403,,Conservatives
We will strengthen universities and colleges’ civic role.,606.1,,Conservatives
"We will invest in local adult education and require the Office for Students to look at universities’ success in increasing access across all ages, not just young people entering full-time undergraduate degrees.",403,,Conservatives
"As well as making Britain the best place to start a business,",402,,Conservatives
"and the best place to learn and develop your skills,",411,,Conservatives
we want to make the UK the best place in the world to work.,701,,Conservatives
The increase in employment that the Conservative Government has overseen since 2010 is proof that there is no contradiction between high employment and high standards,701,,Conservatives
– between dynamic growth and protecting employees from unfair policies and discriminatory treatment.,701,,Conservatives
"Over the last year, for example, unemployment has continued to fall,",701,,Conservatives
even as average real wages have increased.,701,,Conservatives
"We have raised the personal income tax allowance,",401,,Conservatives
and introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage to ensure that people get to keep more of what they earn,401,,Conservatives
"And we have aimed to strike the right balance between the flexibility that the economy needs and the security that employees deserve,",403,,Conservatives
introducing new protections for workers,701,,Conservatives
while preserving the dynamism and job creation that drive our shared prosperity.,403,,Conservatives
"Once we have got Brexit done, we will go further.",701,,Conservatives
"Because people cannot fulfil their potential if they do not have jobs that treat them with dignity and respect,",701,,Conservatives
and if they are not in control of their lives and their futures.,701,,Conservatives
"As Conservatives we will always prioritise the principle of fairness in the workplace, whether it is in the job application process,",701,,Conservatives
"ensuring equal pay for equal work,",701,,Conservatives
or people’s working conditions.,701,,Conservatives
We scrapped exclusivity clauses in zero hours contracts to give workers more flexibility.,701,,Conservatives
We have already taken forward a number of recommendations from the Taylor Review and will build on existing employment law with measures that protect those in low-paid work and the gig economy.,701,,Conservatives
"For example: We will create a single enforcement body and crack down on any employer abusing employment law, whether by taking workers’ tips or refusing them sick pay.",701,,Conservatives
We will ensure that workers have the right to request a more predictable contract and other reasonable protections.,701,,Conservatives
We also want to look at more radical ways to support working families in the UK.,701,,Conservatives
Our lifestyles have been transformed over the last four decades – many families today have two working parents who are juggling work and other responsibilities.,701,,Conservatives
"They have to stretch themselves daily to care for children, elderly relatives and those with disabilities.",701,,Conservatives
"For women, who still tend to be the main carers in households, this can have a big impact on their careers and limit their participation in the workplace.",701,,Conservatives
"But while the modern workplace is adapting as a result, we can do more as a Government to make things easier, learning from sensible approaches adopted in other countries.",701,,Conservatives
We will therefore introduce a raft of measures that balance the needs of employees and employers:,403,,Conservatives
We will encourage flexible working and consult on making it the default unless employers have good reasons not to.,701,,Conservatives
We have reformed redundancy law so companies cannot discriminate against women immediately after returning from maternity leave.,701,,Conservatives
"We will legislate to allow parents to take extended leave for neonatal care, to support those new mothers and fathers who need it during the most vulnerable and stressful days of their lives.",701,,Conservatives
And we will look at ways to make it easier for fathers to take paternity leave.,701,,Conservatives
"We will extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers, the majority of whom are women, to a week.",505,,Conservatives
"Over the last nine years, we have extended the offer of free childcare hours to more working parents.",504,,Conservatives
"We know that people value this support, but wish it could be more flexible.",701,,Conservatives
"As outlined above, we will fund more high-quality childcare before and after school and during the holidays",504,,Conservatives
so that working parents do not have to choose between their careers and their children.,701,,Conservatives
"Our vision for the labour market, in other words, is not one where the state does everything for you.",401,,Conservatives
"It is one where the state does everything it can to help you help yourself – by upgrading your skills,",411,,Conservatives
or by being able to balance work and family life.,701,,Conservatives
It is one in which a deep commitment to entrepreneurship and business is matched,401,,Conservatives
"by a desire to ensure that the jobs that are created are highly skilled, well-paid and fulfilling.",701,,Conservatives
The UK has a proud record of innovation and discovery.,601.1,,Conservatives
"We are the country that gave the world penicillin, the World Wide Web, the theories of gravity and evolution, that unravelled the structure of DNA.",601.1,,Conservatives
The University of Cambridge alone has played host to more Nobel laureates than have been produced by any country in the world bar the United States.,601.1,,Conservatives
"More, indeed, than France, Japanand China – combined.",601.1,,Conservatives
That spirit of discovery is still alive in this country today.,601.1,,Conservatives
But we have not always turned our genius for innovation into jobs and companies here in Britain.,401,,Conservatives
EU regulations have been another barrier to innovation.,110,,Conservatives
"We need to use science and research to unite and level up our country, giving people opportunity and hope.",411,,Conservatives
"Once we have got Brexit done, we will turn our attention to the great challenges of the future such as clean energy and advanced energy storage;",501,,Conservatives
To do this we will make an unprecedented investment in science so we can strengthen research and build the foundations for the new industries of tomorrow.,411,,Conservatives
"We are committing to the fastest ever increase in domestic public R&D spending, including in basic science research to meet our target of 2.4 per cent of GDP being spent on R&D across the economy.",411,,Conservatives
"Some of this new spending will go to a new agency for high-risk, high-payoff research, at arm’s length from government.",401,,Conservatives
We will continue to support our outstanding science sector as we leave the EU.,411,,Conservatives
"Unlike Corbyn’s Labour, we will not spend blindly and wastefully.",414,,Conservatives
"We will focus our efforts on areas where the UK can generate a commanding lead in the industries of the future – life sciences, clean energy, space, design, computing, robotics and artificial intelligence.",411,,Conservatives
"In particular, we will make the UK the leading global hub for life sciences after Brexit.",411,,Conservatives
We will use our £1 billion Ayrton Fund to develop affordable and accessible clean energy that will improve lives,416.2,,Conservatives
and help us to lead the world in tackling climate change.,501,,Conservatives
We will use our increased R&D funding from Government to attract and kickstart private investment.,401,,Conservatives
We will support international collaboration and exchange and ensure UK teams can recruit the skills and talent they need from abroad.,401,,Conservatives
We will reform the science funding system to cut the time wasted by scientists filling in forms.,401,,Conservatives
"We will unlock long-term capital in pension funds to invest in and commercialise our scientific discoveries,",402,,Conservatives
creating a vibrant science-based economy post-Brexit.,402,,Conservatives
"We will continue to collaborate internationally and with the EU on scientific research, including Horizon.",107,,Conservatives
"These unprecedented increases to the science budget will be used to drive forward the development of technologies of critical importance to the UK,",411,,Conservatives
by investing in clusters around world-leading universities and spreading knowledge.,401,,Conservatives
But it isn’t just about laboratory work.,411,,Conservatives
The UK is at its best when it allies its extraordinary design and artistic abilities with science and technology.,411,,Conservatives
"The Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2022 – a national celebration which coincides with the Birmingham Commonwealth Games – will encourage our leading arts and cultural organisations, universities, research institutes and businesses to come together to inspire the next generation in British innovation and creativity.",601.1,,Conservatives
"We will invest in world-class computing and health data systems that can aid research, such as the ground-breaking genetic sequencing carried out at the UK Biobank, Genomics England and the new Accelerating the Detection of Disease project, which has the potential to transform diagnosis and treatment.",411,,Conservatives
We will use government procurement to support new ideas and new companies.,402,,Conservatives
We will continue to support charities which have helped to transform our public services.,402,,Conservatives
"Alongside investing in science, we will maintain our support for the arts and culture, taking pride in the world-beating strengths of the UK’s creative industries and its unparalleled cultural heritage.",502,,Conservatives
"In addition to our new support for arts in schools,",502,,Conservatives
"business rates relief for music venues and cinemas,",403,,Conservatives
and the largest cultural capital programme in a century – £250 million to support local libraries and museums,502,,Conservatives
– we will maintain support for creative sector tax reliefs,402,,Conservatives
and free entry to the UK’s national museums.,502,,Conservatives
"Once we have got Brexit done, we will free our farmers from the bureaucratic Common Agricultural Policy and move to a system based on ‘public money for public goods’.",110,,Conservatives
"To support this transition, we will guarantee the current annual budget to farmers in every year of the next Parliament.",703.1,,Conservatives
"In return for funding, they must farm in a way that protects and enhances our natural environment,",501,,Conservatives
as well as safeguarding high standards of animal welfare.,501,,Conservatives
"When we leave the EU, we will be able to encourage the public sector to ‘Buy British’ to support our farmers by investing in clusters around world-leading universities and spreading knowledge.",406,,Conservatives
and reduce environmental costs.,501,,Conservatives
"We will increase the annual quota for the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme we are piloting from 2,500 to 10,000.",703.1,,Conservatives
"Upon leaving the EU, we will leave the Common Fisheries Policy, becoming an independent coastal state and taking back control of our waters.",406,,Conservatives
We will maintain funding for fisheries across the UK’s nations throughout the Parliament,406,,Conservatives
and support the regeneration of our coastal communities.,406,,Conservatives
There will be a legal commitment to fish sustainably,416.2,,Conservatives
and a legal requirement for a plan to achieve maximum sustainable yield for each stock.,416.2,,Conservatives
"Even as the UK forges ahead in the future, we must not forget those communities that have not shared fully in the growth generated by our economy.",503,,Conservatives
This Government is committed to levelling up all parts of the United Kingdom,503,,Conservatives
"– and getting Brexit done will enable us to give new support to people in rural and coastal communities,",503,,Conservatives
and for our farming and fishing industries.,703.1,,Conservatives
We intend to make their lives much easier.,703.1,,Conservatives
"We want to roll out gigabit broadband across the country by 2025, with £5 billion in funding already promised,",411,,Conservatives
and provide greater mobile coverage across the country.,411,,Conservatives
We will use our additional police resources to tackle rural crime.,605.1,,Conservatives
"For areas – such as some coastal towns – which have historically been poorly served in terms of education and public services (among much else), we will cement our Opportunity Areas programme to raise standards and support regeneration.",410,,Conservatives
"We will also invest in the bus network to improve infrequent or non-existent services in the countryside, including more on-demand services",411,,Conservatives
"Just as in the wider economy we can combine strong employment growth with high employment standards,",701,,Conservatives
so we believe that British farmers and fishermen should be able to profit by producing food and fish that are the envy of the world – both for their quality and the high standards to which they were produced.,703.1,,Conservatives
"We want people, both at home and abroad, to be lining up to buy British.",601.1,,Conservatives
"And one of the great opportunities of Brexit is the chance to lead the world in the quality of our food, agriculture and land management – driven by science-led, evidence-based policy.",601.1,,Conservatives
"And we want those same farmers and fishermen to act as the stewards of the natural world, preserving the UK’s countryside and oceans as they have for generations.",501,,Conservatives
Our Environment Bill will guarantee that we will protect and restore our natural environment after leaving the EU.,501,,Conservatives
Because conservation has always been at the very heart of Conservatism.,501,,Conservatives
We will set up a new independent Office For Environmental Protection,501,,Conservatives
"and introduce our own legal targets, including for air quality.",501,,Conservatives
"We will invest in nature, helping us to reach our Net Zero target with a £640 million new Nature for Climate fund.",501,,Conservatives
"Building on our support for creating a Great Northumberland Forest, we will reach an additional 75,000 acres of trees a year by the end of the next Parliament,",501,,Conservatives
as well as restoring our peatland.,501,,Conservatives
"We welcome the Glover Review and will create new National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty,",501,,Conservatives
"as well as making our most loved landscapes greener, happier, healthier and open to all.",501,,Conservatives
We will make the coast to coast path across the most beautiful areas of the North a National Trail.,501,,Conservatives

"We will ban the export of plastic waste to non-OECD countries, consulting with industry, NGOs and local councils on the date by which this should be achieved.",403,,Conservatives
We will crack down on the waste and carelessness that destroys our natural environment and kills marine life.,501,,Conservatives
"We will increase penalties for fly-tipping,",605.1,,Conservatives
"make those on community sentences clean up their parks and streets,",501,,Conservatives
and introduce a deposit return scheme to incentivise people to recycle plastic and glass.,403,,Conservatives
The United Kingdom is the most successful political and economic union in history.,601.1,,Conservatives
"Together, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are safer, stronger and more prosperous.",601.1,,Conservatives
"For more than 300 years, our people have built this great country together.",601.1,,Conservatives
And we believe our best days lie ahead.,601.1,,Conservatives
"By getting Brexit done, we will deliver certainty so that all four nations of the UK can move on together.",203,,Conservatives
"This will allow us to strengthen the Union, by making it our mission as a Government to work for the whole of the United Kingdom, delivering for all of its people wherever they live.",203,,Conservatives
"UK Shared Prosperity Fund: The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will be used to bind together the whole of the United Kingdom, tackling inequality and deprivation in each of our four nations.",301,,Conservatives
It will replace the overly bureaucratic EU Structural Funds,110,,Conservatives
"– and not only be better targeted at the UK’s specific needs, but at a minimum match the size of those funds in each nation.",301,,Conservatives
"Strengthening the Union: Conservatives have a proud history of upholding and strengthening the devolution settlements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",301,,Conservatives
We also want to ensure that the UK Government and its institutions are working effectively to realise the benefits of four nations working together as one United Kingdom.,203,,Conservatives
We will carefully consider the recommendations of Lord Dunlop’s Independent Review into UK Government Union capability when it is published as we work to strengthen our Union going forward.,203,,Conservatives
Freeports: We will aim to ensure that our new freeports benefit the people in each of the four nations.,401,,Conservatives
We believe that there are many places across the United Kingdom that have the opportunity to be successful innovative hubs for global trade.,401,,Conservatives
Northern Ireland enjoys huge benefits from membership of the United Kingdom and our country is stronger and richer for Northern Ireland being part of it.,203,,Conservatives
"That is why we will never be neutral on the Union and why we stand for a proud, confident, inclusive and modern unionism that affords equal respect to all traditions and parts of the community.",203,,Conservatives
Our commitment to the 1998 Belfast Agreement and its successor agreements is unshakeable and we will not deviate from the principle of consent or the three-stranded approach.,301,,Conservatives
We will continue to work with all sides to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly so that the people of Northern Ireland can enjoy the full advantages of devolved government for the benefit of the whole community.,301,,Conservatives
Guaranteeing the full economic benefits of Brexit: Northern Ireland will enjoy the full economic benefits of Brexit including new free trade agreements with the rest of the world.,401,,Conservatives
We will ensure that Northern Ireland’s businesses and producers enjoy unfettered access to the rest of the UK,406,,Conservatives
"and that in the implementation of our Brexit deal, we maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market.",406,,Conservatives
"Turbocharging the Northern Ireland economy: After Brexit, we will support the Northern Ireland Executive to improve infrastructure,",411,,Conservatives
reduce public sector dependence,505,,Conservatives
and make the most of our new City Deals.,402,,Conservatives
We intend to devolve responsibility for corporation tax,301,,Conservatives
and will consider the same for short-haul Air Passenger Duty to serve our goal of making our Union more prosperous and connected than ever before.,301,,Conservatives
Security and legacy issues: Keeping people safe and secure will always be our priority.,605.1,,Conservatives
That means taking action to tackle the threat from terrorism and the scourge of paramilitarism.,605.1,,Conservatives
We will also never forget the immense contribution of the police and Armed Forces in standing firm against terrorists in the past,605.1,,Conservatives
and the debt we owe them for peace today.,605.1,,Conservatives
We will continue to seek better ways of dealing with legacy issues that provide better outcomes for victims and survivors,605.1,,Conservatives
and do more to give veterans the protections they deserve.,605.1,,Conservatives
Twelve years of SNP government have led to an obsessive focus on independence – all while Scotland’s public services and its economy have been neglected.,601.1,,Conservatives
"So long as the SNP are in power, Scottish schools and hospitals will always take second place to the pursuit of another independence referendum.",601.1,,Conservatives
"We are opposed to a second independence referendum and stand with the majority of people in Scotland, who do not want to return to division and uncertainty.",601.1,,Conservatives
Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP promised that the 2014 referendum would be a ‘once in a generation’ vote and the result was decisive.,601.1,,Conservatives
We believe that outcome should be respected.,601.1,,Conservatives
"Only the Scottish Conservatives can block a Sturgeon/Corbyn alliance and stop a second independence referendum,",601.1,,Conservatives
so that we can get Brexit sorted,110,,Conservatives
and Scotland can move on from uncertainty and division.,601.1,,Conservatives
"A post-Brexit deal for Scottish fishing: As outlined above, we will leave the Common Fisheries Policy,",110,,Conservatives
and take back control of our waters in December 2020.,406,,Conservatives
"Alcohol Duty Review: Scotch whisky is a national export that supports 42,000 jobs across the UK.",406,,Conservatives
Yet the tax on each bottle of Scotch sold in this country represents almost three quarters of its price.,402,,Conservatives
"That is why over the past two years we have frozen the duty on spirits, cutting the price of a bottle of Scotch by 30p.",402,,Conservatives
"Now, we want to do more, which is why we will review alcohol duty to ensure that our tax system is supporting British drink producers.",402,,Conservatives
"Oil and gas sector deal: The oil and gas industry employs almost 300,000 people, of whom four in 10 work in Scotland.",406,,Conservatives
We believe that the North Sea oil and gas industry has a long future ahead and know the sector has a key role to play as we move to a Net Zero economy.,406,,Conservatives
We will support this transition in the next Parliament with a transformational sector deal.,416.2,,Conservatives
"In the 2016 referendum, Wales voted to Leave – yet the Welsh Labour Government and Plaid Cymru are intent on overturning that decision by holding another referendum on our membership of the EU.",110,,Conservatives
Only the Welsh Conservatives can end the current uncertainty by delivering on the democratic decision of the Welsh people to Leave,110,,Conservatives
so we can unleash Wales’s potential as part of the United Kingdom.,601.1,,Conservatives
We are ambitious for the Welsh economy and for our Union.,601.1,,Conservatives
"We will ensure that Wales gets a fair deal, with major investments in infrastructure and industry to deliver real opportunity across the nation.",411,,Conservatives
"After Brexit, we will continue to be a champion for Welsh exports and Wales’s presence on the global stage as part of a strong United Kingdom.",406,,Conservatives
"Marches Growth Deal: Too often infrastructure is focused on national connectivity within England and within Wales, rather than across the communities which live and work near the border.",301,,Conservatives
"We will work with the WelshGovernment and councils on both sides of the border to negotiate a transformative Marches Growth Deal,",301,,Conservatives
focusing on cross-border infrastructure which supports the local and cross-border economy.,411,,Conservatives
This will be modelled on the successful collaboration between governments and councils through the Borderlands Growth Deal in Northern England and the South of Scotland – building on the work of the Western Gateway partnership we have already announced.,301,,Conservatives
"Transport: To support our Union, we will upgrade the A55 as the main road transport artery for North Wales",411,,Conservatives
– improving its capacity and resilience to build connections between Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom.,411,,Conservatives
A Welsh Conservative Government would deliver the M4 relief road which has been mothballed by the Labour administration.,411,,Conservatives
"We gave financial support to the Welsh Government to build the relief road, yet the Labour administration decided to abandon those plans out of timidity.",305.1,,Conservatives
This road is a vital economic lifeline and its cancellation shows that Wales is continually being held back by the Labour Welsh Government.,305.1,,Conservatives
We will also deliver on our commitment to fund the building of the West Wales Parkway Station outside of Swansea.,411,,Conservatives
Automotive industry: The automotive industry in Wales sustains tens of thousands of jobs and we believe that it has a bright future ahead.,701,,Conservatives
"In September, we worked to bring INEOS Automotive to Bridgend, which will create 500 new jobs.",701,,Conservatives

"As Conservatives, we stand for democracy and the rule of law.",202.1,,Conservatives
Our independent courts and legal system are respected throughout the world.,202.1,,Conservatives
"One of the strengths of the UK’s constitution is its ability to evolve – as times have changed, so have Parliament, government and the judiciary.",203,,Conservatives
"Today, that need is greater than ever.",203,,Conservatives
The failure of Parliament to deliver Brexit,202.1,,Conservatives
– the way so many MPs have devoted themselves to thwarting the democratic decision of the British people in the2016 referendum,202.1,,Conservatives
– has opened up a destabilising and potentially extremely damaging rift between politicians and people.,202.1,,Conservatives
"If the Brexit chaos continues, with a second referendum and a second Scottish referendum too, they will lose faith even further.",202.1,,Conservatives
It is only by getting Brexit done that we can start the necessary task of restoring public trust in government and politics:,202.1,,Conservatives
We will get rid of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act – it has led to paralysis at a time the country needed decisive action.,202.1,,Conservatives
"We will ensure we have updated and equal Parliamentary boundaries, making sure that every vote counts the same – a cornerstone of democracy.",202.1,,Conservatives
"We will continue to support the First Past the Post system of voting, as it allows voters to kick out politicians who don’t deliver, both locally and nationally.",202.1,,Conservatives

stopping postal vote harvesting,202.1,,Conservatives

We will maintain the voting age at 18 – the age at which one gains full citizenship rights.,201.2,,Conservatives
"We will ensure that no one is put off from engaging in politics or standing in an election by threats, harassment or abuse, whether in person or online.",202.1,,Conservatives
"We will champion freedom of expression and tolerance, both in the UK and overseas.",201.2,,Conservatives
"To support free speech, we will repeal section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2014, which seeks to coerce the press.",201.2,,Conservatives
We will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry.,201.2,,Conservatives
We will ensure redundancy payments can be clawed back when high-paid public servants move between jobs.,304,,Conservatives
"We will improve the use of data, data science and evidence in the process of government.",303,,Conservatives
"Once we get Brexit done, Britain will take back control of its laws.",110,,Conservatives
"As we end the supremacy of European law, we will be free to craft legislation and regulations that maintain high standards but which work best for the UK.",601.1,,Conservatives
"We want a balance of rights, rules and entitlements that benefits all the people and all the parts of our United Kingdom.",201.2,,Conservatives
"After Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution: the relationship between the Government, Parliament and the courts;",204,,Conservatives
the functioning of the Royal Prerogative;,204,,Conservatives
the role of the House of Lords;,204,,Conservatives
and access to justice for ordinary people.,204,,Conservatives
The ability of our security services to defend us against terrorism and organised crime is critical.,204,,Conservatives

"We will ensure that judicial review is available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state,",201.1,,Conservatives
while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays.,202.1,,Conservatives
"In our first year we will set up a Constitution, Democracy & Rights Commission that will examine these issues in depth,",204,,Conservatives
and come up with proposals to restore trust in our institutions and in how our democracy operates.,204,,Conservatives
"As Conservatives, we are immensely proud of the UK’s history and its standing in the world.",601.1,,Conservatives
"Unlike those currently leading the Labour Party, we view our country as a force for good.",601.1,,Conservatives
"The strength of the Armed Forces, our alliances with like-minded democracies and our willingness to act are all reasons for the UK to hold its head high.",601.1,,Conservatives
So too is our work in promoting international development,107,,Conservatives
– both issues on which the Conservative Party and Conservative Governments have driven the agenda forward.,305.1,,Conservatives
"And in an uncertain world, in which the threat of terrorism, rogue states and malign non-state actors is ever-present, it is vital that Britain stands up and is counted.",601.1,,Conservatives
Getting Brexit done will allow us to do more on the international stage.,110,,Conservatives
"We will continue to be an outward-looking country that is a champion of collective security,",107,,Conservatives
and a rules-based international system.,107,,Conservatives

We will open new markets and support free trade and global growth.,401,,Conservatives
"We will build on our fantastic track record of delivering major international sporting events – including supporting the upcoming Commonwealth Games,",601.1,,Conservatives
UEFA European Women’s Championships,601.1,,Conservatives
– and we would back a potential UK and Ireland bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup,601.1,,Conservatives
"As we extend our diplomatic network, we will reinvigorate relationships with Europe and seek to strengthen old and new partnerships across the world.",107,,Conservatives
We will work with our cultural institutions like the BBC and British Council to expand our influence and project our values.,601.1,,Conservatives
"And unlike Jeremy Corbyn, we will stand up to foreign countries that threaten the stability of Europe,",107,,Conservatives
or commit state-sanctioned murder on British soil.,605.1,,Conservatives
"A Conservative Government understands the sacrifices made by Armed Forces personnel, veterans and their families.",104,,Conservatives
That is why we will introduce new legislation to tackle the vexatious legal claims that undermine our Armed Forces and further incorporate the Armed Forces Covenant into law.,104,,Conservatives
We will continue to acknowledge and commemorate the invaluable contribution of diaspora communities in previous armed conflicts.,104,,Conservatives
"We also recognise the contribution in the present day of so many from beyond these shores, such as the Gurkhas.",104,,Conservatives
"In addition, we will bring in a range of measures to support former and current Service personnel.",104,,Conservatives
We will reduce National Insurance contributions for employers if they employ ex-Service personnel.,104,,Conservatives

Those excluded or overlooked by the current means-tested system will see the biggest benefits.,504,,Greens
"This includes low to medium income families with children, young people and students, and some pensioners.",503,,Greens
Someone earning the minimum wage and working 37.5 hours a week would see their income increase by 10 to 15% through UBI.,504,,Greens
"UBI will also start to challenge how work is often valued as simply about earning money to drive consumption,",416.2,,Greens

"UBI will be an unconditional payment, paid to all UK residents regardless of employment status.",606.1,,Greens
Replace most income-related benefits with UBI (except for the additional benefits described below).,504,,Greens
Replacing a large range of variously means-tested benefits with one unconditional payment will simplify and streamline the system.,504,,Greens
Ensure nobody will be worse off.,503,,Greens
The adult rate of UBI of £89 per week will result in around a 6% increase in disposable income over five years for someone in full¬time work and paid the average salary.,504,,Greens
It is our firm intention to increase in particular adult rates at regular intervals during the first full parliamentary term.,504,,Greens
Include additional payments above the basic adult rate for some groups of people:,504,,Greens
Pensioners will receive a weekly payment totalling £178.,504,,Greens

"Families with an income of over £50,000 per year will receive smaller additional supplements per child,",504,,Greens
with the amount decreasing further the more a family earns.,505,,Greens
"Draw directly on income from the Carbon Tax to help fund UBI,",504,,Greens
thereby ensuring that the proceeds of the tax on carbon emissions help meet the cost of enabling people to make the transition to a carbon free future.,501,,Greens
These reforms will integrate closely with the proposals set out in the ‘Delivering secure incomes and homes’ section on page 49.,504,,Greens
"The remainder of this Manifesto sets out four related programmes of reform that will help a Green New Deal to succeed - remaining in the EU,",108,,Greens

"This will mean that the unacceptable practices of compulsory treatment, chemical and physical restraint, isolation, and seclusion are made illegal in the UK.",201.2,,Greens
"Everyone has the right to feel safe - on the street, in their home or online.",605.1,,Greens
Simple things like more police on the beat and enforceable laws against malicious trolling can make a huge difference.,605.1,,Greens
"However, not all crime can be tackled by being tough.",605.2,,Greens
"It might make us feel better, but it doesn’t change very much.",605.2,,Greens
The Green Party thinks it’s time to transform our justice system.,605.2,,Greens
"We want to tackle the underlying causes of crime more effectively than CCTV cameras, stop and search or draconian sentencing can ever do.",605.2,,Greens
"So we will focus on the prevention of crime with community-based policing, alongside investment in education and employment.",605.2,,Greens
"Overall, we aim to halve the prison population, as has successfully been achieved in the Netherlands, breaking the vicious cycle of reoffending.",605.2,,Greens
"60% of newly released short-term prisoners reoffend in the year after their release, often graduating to more serious crimes than the one for which they were originally imprisoned.",605.2,,Greens
"We will expand restorative justice when crimes do take place, both to give victims a voice and to help offenders see the effects of what they have done and take responsibility.",605.2,,Greens

"Over the last 50 years, the international war on drugs has been a resounding failure.",605.2,,Greens
Harmful drug consumption has markedly increased and has given rise to a multi-billion pound illegal industry that has fuelled organised violent crime,605.2,,Greens
and caused untold social and ecological destruction.,605.2,,Greens
There is little evidence for the two core assumptions that form the basis of current UK drug policy:,605.2,,Greens
1. That supply-side enforcement can reduce drug availability and use.,605.2,,Greens
2. That the criminalisation of people who use drugs is an effective deterrent.,605.2,,Greens
"The Green Party recognises that people have always and will always use drugs, including alcohol.",605.2,,Greens
"Drugs perform many purposes in society, including recreational use and as part of medical treatment.",605.2,,Greens
Seeking to prevent drug use is demonstrably futile; we need a radically new system grounded in harm reduction.,605.2,,Greens
Government needs to strike the right balance between responsible adult drug use and the potential harms of problematic use.,605.2,,Greens
The taxes and licence fees that will apply to drugs under our proposed system will raise significant revenues.,605.2,,Greens
"Some of these revenues will pay for the harm that drug use can cause, including NHS time.",605.2,,Greens
Our Green plan to reduce harm and adopt an evidence-based approach will: Repeal the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.,605.2,,Greens

"We think it’s time for a better future, where animals are actively protected from cruelty and our own quality of life is improved too.",501,,Greens
The Green plan to transform understanding of the relationship between humans and animals will: Guarantee the principle of animal sentience.,501,,Greens
This will mean that that regard for the welfare needs of animals as sentient beings is uppermost in formulating and implementing relevant government policy.,501,,Greens
"This includes trail hunting, where dogs are used to track foxes who are then shot,",501,,Greens
and the commercial shooting of deer and game birds.,501,,Greens
"Government subsidies, used to maintain artificial landscapes designed only for hunting (such as grouse moors) will be ended and the land rewilded where possible.",501,,Greens

"Call on all nations to declare the waters under their control as havens from whaling,",501,,Greens
"to provide sanctuary throughout those waters for cetaceans (whales and dolphins),",501,,Greens
and to co-operate in achieving global sanctuary for cetaceans in the longer term.,501,,Greens
Implement a complete ban on cages and close confinement,501,,Greens
and deliberate mutilation of farm animals.,501,,Greens
"Help shoppers choose cruelty free food, with mandatory method of production labelling for meat, milk and dairy products.",501,,Greens
Protect animals that give companionship or support.,501,,Greens

Those convicted of cruelty will be placed on an animal cruelty register and prevented from working with animals again.,605.1,,Greens
"Encourage the use of companion animals in therapy and other treatments, drawing on evidence showing the beneficial impact of contact with animals on human psychology.",501,,Greens
"Create a new Commission on Animal Protection, responsible for overseeing all rules designed to protect animals from cruelty.",501,,Greens
"This Commission will ensure that the highest standards of animal welfare are applied to companion animals, farm animals and wildlife.",501,,Greens
This will ensure that the right of all sentient beings not to be subject to undue suffering is always respected.,501,,Greens
We’re the fifth largest economy in the world and yet today there are 4 million children living in poverty.,503,,Greens
"The streets of our cities are home to 4,000 rough sleepers.",503,,Greens
Nurses are going to foodbanks to put dinner on the table.,503,,Greens
We can do so much better than this.,503,,Greens
It’s a question of political choices.,503,,Greens

Talking about the problem isn’t enough - it’s time to act.,503,,Greens
We will redistribute wealth and lift everyone up.,503,,Greens
We want to enable people to build secure lives and livelihoods.,503,,Greens
"Alongside giving everyone a minimum level of security with a Universal Basic Income,",504,,Greens
we will make our tax system fit for purpose - fairer and more effective at bringing in revenue for public services,504,,Greens
and funding the Green New Deal.,501,,Greens
"We see tax as the primary way most of us contribute towards our own and the common good - a fair and valuable payment towards a well-functioning, just society that protects citizens",606.1,,Greens
and the planet which sustains us.,501,,Greens

"Above all, we will transform our tax system, so it is able to generate the funds needed to deliver good public services",504,,Greens
"and the Green New Deal, and deliver ongoing economic, climate and social justice.",501,,Greens
Our current system of income taxes is hugely complex.,303,,Greens
Those seeking to avoid tax are able to use this complexity to their advantage.,503,,Greens
"Tax avoiders can shift their money in and out of different income and asset categories, switching category just before the tax official catches up with them.",503,,Greens
A whole tax avoidance industry exists to guide those prepared to pay to wriggle out of tax through the cracks in the system.,503,,Greens
"This charade keeps billions of pounds out of the public purse every year, money that could be spent on new homes, schools and hospitals.",504,,Greens
"It’s time to straighten out the tax system, so that tax avoiders can no longer evade their responsibilities,",503,,Greens
and so that income from wealth is taxed the same as income from work.,503,,Greens
This will ensure that the wealthiest pay their fair share.,503,,Greens
Our Green plan to simplify tax will shine a light on the corners of the economy where the richest stash their wealth.,503,,Greens
"We will: Merge Employees National Insurance, Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax, Dividend Tax and Income Tax into a single Consolidated Income Tax.",503,,Greens
This closing of loopholes will bring in an estimated £20 billion extra per year into the public purse.,504,,Greens
It will mean that all income is treated the same way for tax purposes.,503,,Greens

Replace the Income Tax threshold with Universal Basic Income.,504,,Greens
"End the double taxation of pension funds, which are currently subject to Corporation Tax and then Income Tax when paid out to individual pensioners.",504,,Greens
The Green Party wants to transform land and property taxes.,503,,Greens
Half of England is owned by less than 1% of its population.,503,,Greens
Our tax system allows landlords to sit on land and do nothing whilst public money for enhancements sees land value increase.,503,,Greens
"It is one of the main ways of taxing wealth, yet bands are still based on valuations from 1991.",503,,Greens
This means someone in a multi-million pound property pays a far lower proportion of tax than someone in a one-bedroom flat.,503,,Greens
"All the while, small and independent businesses are crying out for reform of the unfair business rates system,",402,,Greens
and young people face a lifetime of housing insecurity and high prices.,503,,Greens
"Over the long term we will take steps to replace the current unjust, out-of¬date system with a Land Value Tax (LVT), designed to redistribute wealth",503,,Greens
and help fix our broken housing market.,403,,Greens
"LVT will be a single tax (replacing the multiple taxes that currently exist) which will capture the real value of land, and the increased value arising from improvements to it.",503,,Greens
"Winston Churchill backed an LVT, arguing that the value added to a property because of improvements, like transport infrastructure, paid for by the public purse, should be returned to the community.",503,,Greens
The many other benefits include bringing more brownfield sites into use;,416.2,,Greens
discouraging speculative land banking;,416.2,,Greens
"and more efficient, sustainable use of land.",416.2,,Greens
"LVT will help stabilise the property market and shift the burden of taxation from land users, including renters and business tenants, to wealthy landowners.",503,,Greens
It’s a critical part of how to tackle the housing crisis.,503,,Greens
"Our Green plan to transform land and property taxes will: Abolish Council Tax and Business Rates, replacing them with an LVT.",503,,Greens
"The LVT will also absorb National Non-domestic Rates, Stamp Duty on Land, Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings, Capital Gains Tax on land sales, Inheritance Tax on land and Income Tax on land for owner- occupiers.",503,,Greens
The new LVT will charge the landowner a proportion of the capital value of the land each year (estimated to be around 1.4% of current values).,403,,Greens
Ensure LVT is paid by landowners regardless of whether or not they live on the land.,403,,Greens
This will incentivise those who own empty properties to release them back into the housing market.,402,,Greens
"Lift millions of renters and business tenants out of property taxes altogether, by shifting the burden of land taxation from land users to landowners.",403,,Greens
We will legislate to prevent landowners passing these tax costs back to renters and tenants.,403,,Greens
"Phase in the changes over ten years, with reliefs on offer.",403,,Greens
This will ensure that the vast majority of homeowners will face similar or lower levels of tax to that which they pay now.,403,,Greens
Protect those who have low incomes but who are ‘land rich’ with a right to defer the tax until the property is sold or transferred.,403,,Greens
"Likewise, pensioners who are homeowners will be enabled to ‘roll over’ LVT payments until their property is sold, so they don’t feel undue pressure to move.",403,,Greens
"In the long term, the new LVT will bring in more money for the public purse.",303,,Greens
"However due to the phased introduction of the policy, and the reliefs we will offer to help homeowners transition to the new system, we estimate that the LVT will be revenue neutral for the first ten years (bringing in the same amount of revenue as the taxes it replaces).",403,,Greens
In a transformed green economy we will need to harness the power and influence of businesses to do good.,416.2,,Greens
"At the moment, huge corporations tend to use their power to generate profit for a small number of people and to reduce the amount of tax they pay.",403,,Greens
"We think it’s time to straighten things out, so nobody can abuse the tax system and dodge their responsibilities.",403,,Greens
"When Corporation Tax was first introduced to the UK in 1965, it stood at 40%. Now it’s at 19%, one of the lowest in Europe.",403,,Greens
And overseas giants like Amazon and Google exploit tax loopholes to pay even less.,403,,Greens
"Businesses can be the bedrock of an economy that enables us all to thrive, if they pay what they owe and invest in the public services and infrastructure from which they benefit.",403,,Greens
"Our plan for tax justice Increase the rate of Corporation Tax to 24%, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co¬operation and Development (OECD) average.",403,,Greens
We will advocate public country-by-country reporting and consolidated Corporate Tax across the EU to prevent profit shifting,108,,Greens
"This will counteract the huge levels of support previous governments have given the banking sector, through public protections, licenses and subsidies.",403,,Greens
"We will also close a loophole in the Stamp Duty on Shares, by including share purchases of all values and new share issues within the Duty.",403,,Greens
"Establish HM Revenue & Customs as an independent agency of government, answerable to Parliament.",303,,Greens
This will remove the power of politicians to strike secret deals with powerful corporations and individuals.,304,,Greens
Entrench the anti-avoidance principle in UK tax law and oblige banks to provide information about companies automatically to HMRC.,403,,Greens
"Close down Corporation Tax loopholes by widening the definition of ‘profit’ to cover dividends, share buybacks, additions to cash holdings, payments to parent or subsidiary companies (both onshore and offshore), and other distributed income.",403,,Greens
"Clamp down on tax havens internationally and, domestically,",403,,Greens
require offshore companies to reveal their beneficial ownership before being accepted as competitors for publicly funded contracts.,403,,Greens
"In instances where beneficial ownership is not clear and/or payments are made to secretive tax havens, all money and assets transferred will be treated as income distribution and taxed at the full Corporate or Income Tax level.",403,,Greens
We will explore how to best to tackle tax avoidance channelled through British Overseas Territories.,403,,Greens
"We will campaign for the EU to clamp down on member state tax havens, including Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.",403,,Greens
Abolish the rule that allows non¬domiciled residents not to pay tax on foreign income.,403,,Greens
We will transform our economy to make it work for the wellbeing of people and our environment - and we want business to play a leading role.,416.2,,Greens
We want enterprise in the 21st century to be about more than what pays.,416.2,,Greens
"We want to support enterprise to create a bigger, more diverse future, through stakeholder finance, ownership rooted in communities and business done for the common good.",416.2,,Greens
"We recognise the many challenges facing businesses today, especially small, local businesses, run by families or individuals - and the enormous value they bring to the communities they serve.",402,,Greens
We understand how hard it is to start and run a business - and how rewarding it can be when that business grows.,402,,Greens
"We want to transform the business environment in the UK, so enterprise that benefits us all is rewarded and helped to thrive.",416.2,,Greens
"The Green plan for a small business revolution will: Give small businesses access to lending at affordable rates, by helping to establish a network of regional mutual banks.",402,,Greens
"These new banks will be created specifically to provide funding for locally led economic initiatives and opportunities, including co¬operatives, community interest companies and other non-profit businesses.",416.2,,Greens
"Further free up funding by introducing credit guidance for traditional banks, requiring them to increase their lending to small businesses",402,,Greens
and businesses focussed on the sustainability transition.,416.2,,Greens
Grant 15% of government contracts to small and micro businesses.,403,,Greens
"We will revise the government contract application process, to remove the current barriers for entry to small business.",403,,Greens
We will encourage local authorities to adopt this model with their own contracts.,403,,Greens
Require businesses to publish and report the difference between agreed payment days and actual payment days.,403,,Greens
We will introduce fines for large companies that fail to pay small businesses on time.,403,,Greens
Support small business to work with employees to adopt full workplace rights.,701,,Greens
Create new support for entrepreneurs and small business owners from BME backgrounds.,402,,Greens
"Reduce VAT on food and drink served in pubs, bars and restaurants, on hotel bookings and on theatre, music concert and museum and gallery tickets,",403,,Greens
"This will boost the leisure and cultural sectors,",502,,Greens
"helping 125,000 businesses at the heart of their local communities.",402,,Greens
"Increase the Employment Allowance to £10,000 (currently just £3,000) per year, allowing small businesses which employ people to claim back the equivalent National Insurance of four full-time workers earning the average salary.",402,,Greens
"This tax cut will benefit hundreds of thousands of small businesses, allowing them to hire more people, increase wages or reduce prices.",402,,Greens
Promote and support an increase in co-operatives and community interest companies.,416.2,,Greens
Education about these forms of communal enterprise would start in school.,506,,Greens
"Successive governments have committed large sums of public money to projects that contribute nothing to the potential for a safer, fairer future for all.",416.1,,Greens
"Beliefs that big is always best, that growth is good for growths sake and that communities and environments can be sacrificed have left a dreadful legacy of public harm and financial waste.",416.1,,Greens
It’s time to pull the plug on what hasn’t worked so we can invest instead in the Green New Deal and other ways to sustainably transform the state of the nation.,416.2,,Greens
"As we transition to a net zero economy the Green Party will tackle wasteful spending, starting by: Cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system",105,,Greens
and nuclear powered submarines.,105,,Greens
"We will join the United Nation’s Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and work within that multilateral framework work for the total elimination of all nuclear weapons, including the implementation, enforcement and verification of all disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation agreements.",105,,Greens
"We need a security system that can keep us safe from 21st-century challenges, not one that could realise cold war nightmares.",105,,Greens
The funds saved from cancelling Trident will be diverted towards the development of non-carbon- emitting technologies,501,,Greens
and finance to help countries deal with the Climate Emergency.,501,,Greens
"Scrapping the government’s new road building programme, including the proposed road tunnel at Stonehenge that threatens to desecrate an iconic World Heritage Site.",416.1,,Greens
"The funding for this road building programme, the £6.5 billion in revenue received from Vehicle Exercise Duty each year, will be switched to supporting sustainable public transport and new cycleways and footpaths as part of the Green New Deal.",416.2,,Greens
£1.5 billion of Vehicle Exercise Duty revenue will be retained to maintain existing roads.,416.1,,Greens

Scrapping the doomed HS2 rail line.,416.1,,Greens
"The funds freed up will be spent on more effective sustainable public transport options, as part of the Green New Deal.",416.2,,Greens
"This will enable an increase in rail capacity in regions that desperately need more investment, including the creation of three electrified rail lines running from Liverpool and Manchester to Sheffield, Hull and the Tees Valley.",411,,Greens
"These three newly electrified lines will run through Bradford and Leeds, creating new rail hubs in the heart of Yorkshire.",411,,Greens
"Ending the NHS internal market, which has driven up administrative costs in the health service without improving clinical practice, patient care or staff wellbeing.",413,,Greens
"Ending the Help to Buy Programme, which mainly served to drive developer profits.",416.2,,Greens
"The funds will be redirected to the Green Party’s council home creation programme that will deliver attractive, affordable homes for all.",504,,Greens

We will instead allow councils to set discounts locally,301,,Greens
and retain 100% of receipts to reinvest in new and existing homes.,416.2,,Greens
These are the worst offending projects - our review of government spending is likely to consider further vanity projects that need a rethink.,416.2,,Greens
The Green Party’s plans will also deliver savings in the long term.,416.2,,Greens
"By tackling some of society’s major problems head-on, Green policies will free up funds currently allocated to managing the harmful effects of poverty, pollution and illegal drug use.",416.2,,Greens
Poverty alone costs the UK taxpayer an incredible £85 billion per year.,503,,Greens
"Using effective anti-poverty measures such as the Universal Basic Income,",504,,Greens
new job opportunities created by the Green New Deal,701,,Greens
"and increased support for the disabled, pensioners and carers, the Green Party’s programme will slash poverty rates",504,,Greens
and ultimately save billions per year in government spending.,416.2,,Greens
We accept that these savings will take place over a long period of time.,416.2,,Greens
"When they are delivered we will seek to allocate these funds to other areas of public service provision that are currently being underfunded, such as education,",506,,Greens

"The Beveridge Report set out five aspirations which, if met, could build a better future for all:",601.1,,Greens
