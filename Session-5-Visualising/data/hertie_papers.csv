Sie verbessern die Wohlfahrt schützen gleichzeitig Umwelt das Klima. Dies wird erreicht, indem umweltschädigende Aktivitäten einen Preis bekommen, der möglichst exakt Höhe des Schadens entspricht. Eine konsequente Bepreisung externen Kosten nach diesem Prinzip könnte in Deutschland erhebliche zusätzliche Einnahmen erbringen: Basierend bisherigen Studien zu wären Größenordnung von 348 bis 564 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr (44 71 Prozent gesamten Steuereinnahmen) möglich.
